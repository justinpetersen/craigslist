Where can I meet a nice and romantic guy? Tired of the bars/clubs and not going to find someone to go out with at work. Just looking for a guy who likes to go out to movies, dinner, maybe a little dancing, coffee and can be a gentlemen. Not asking for much so tell me where I can find one of these. :) <br>

I'm asian/F/mid 30's/full figured and tall. Your pic will get mine.

I am 27, recently single, and no kids. I grew up in the Bay Area. Personality wise I'm the type that most of the time is in a good mood, friendly, caring, outgoing, and sweet. I love music! Every now and then I find time to hit up a concert. I'm up for random/planned adventures around the Bay Area or beyond. BBQ's, beach trips, bars, movies, bowling, billards, mini golf, chillin at a park, walking through a scenic trail, and spending time with close family and friends are all things I enjoy.<br>
<br>
Anywho, I am looking for men around my area and around my age (25-35) who are looking to spend time with and get to know me. Right now I'm not really sure if I want a long term relationship. I just want us to hang out, enjoy our time together, and just get to know each other. If we decide that indeed there is chemistry, then I'm open to a relationship. Ideally however, I aim for us to get to know each other well so we can then decide. <br>
<br>
So if you want to know more about me then drop me a line! <br>

I mean fun night out with someone where we both have a good time.  Drinking is fine just not interested in the face plant part.  Laugh, joke around and enjoy each others company.  Ideas?

Sure, Craigslist is random. But, so is life. I want to meet someone amazing... wherever he might be!<br>
<br>
I am looking for someone who is beautiful both inside and out. He should be well educated and well traveled. I love witty conversation. . Could he be you? <br>
<br>
I would prefer someone between the ages of 45 - 50. Attach a photo and tell me a bit about yourself.

An accomplished and very well-educated woman of South Asian persuasion, with European style/outlook, I seek company of a like-minded gentleman with integrity, character, and a good sense of humour.

I"m sexy and I know it, and I do work out. I have a lot to offer. I'm very attractive, fit, petite, sensual, passionate, playful, open minded, healthy, clean, honest, humorous, understanding, and discreet. I'm full of positive energy and fun to be around. Moreover, my stylish dresses, high heels, and nylons are just like icing on the cake. What's not to like and adore?<br>
<br>
I've been very fortunate in my life with great lovers and playmates and enjoy every moment of the dating game, however I wouldn't mind some new adventures to spice up my busy life? Something very part time, pressure, drama free, fun and exciting with a romantic twist.<br>
<br>
I must admit that I'm selective. My life is great just as is. I seek an exceptional person who will bring something in my life that I don't need but I will enjoy. CL seems like a strange place, however I have my strong reasons to be here. You must be a professional, VGL WM, 36-50, who can handle a woman like I am.<br>
<br>
Let's enjoy life and share some priceless moments.<br>

I am a Tantrika searching for a beloved consort. You must like radiant, joyous women and understand the fundamentals of tantra. I am not interested in teaching anyone but seek someone for whom the calling has already been heard. This is a path of enlightenment through the senses. It would be wonderful if you lived within 30 mins of the GG Bridge, were of a mature age (45-65) and had the time for a meaningful relationship. I am open hearted, compassionate, attractive, fit, vital and vibrant. I live a life that seems to be getting better all of the time. I will enhance your happiness and your life. If this resonates, please respond. Gentlemen only please.

I'm an affectionate, Jewish, New York native, petite, fit, down to earth, curious, introspective. Still a leftist after all these years. I am serious but playful, practical but passionate, intellectual but not stuffy. I have an urban mind but a rural heart. 52 but look 51. I'm seeking to share a quiet life rich in nature, culture, friends, relatives, ideas and ideals, home. <br>
<br>
On weekends, I typically go hiking in the east bay regional parks. I also enjoy the farmer's market, yoga, reading the New Yorker, films (especially foreign and independent), public radio (especially KALW), and many kinds of music (jazz, classical, folk, and the rock music of my youth.) I have a master's degree in public policy and spent 10 years as a journalist, then shifted to working as a writer/editor helping nonprofit advocacy groups and scholars to get their message out.<br>
<br>
I need a good deal of rest, the result of a rough case of Lyme disease that has had a lasting effect on my stamina. I take an afternoon nap and tend to stay home in the evening. Nevertheless, I have a vibrant personality and I exercise every day. <br>
<br>
I'm looking for a kind, left-leaning man with a searching mind, for a committed relationship. Children are welcome if you have them.<br>

I have discovered recently that the following phrase is correct: "Tell me how you drive and I will tell you what type of man you are". It seems to me that if a man drives 60-65 mph on a freeway with no traffic and clear lanes ahead and I have to tell this man where to change lanes and how to get to places, then he is a weak man, the man who does not take charge and is not in charge. <br>
<br>
I have already met few men who seem to fall under this rule. I find that I am emotionally stronger than this type of men. I am comfortable and secure in who I am and where I am in life. I would like to find a man who is stronger than me, who I can rely on, who can protect me, and who can be a leader. <br>
<br>
Well, what do you think? Are there men out there who know how to take charge and to be in charge? Who knows what chivalry is about? This by no means implies that he is arrogant or not kind. It is just the opposite. He is a gentleman, kind, and compassionate, but he is a Man. You know, like knights were in shining armor in Europe who would take out a sword and stand up for what they believe and for their lady? <br>
<br>
Are there men like this out there? If you are there, come out, I would like to meet you. <br>
<br>
I am a white woman, 49 years old, petite and attractive. I am educated, very intelligent, cultured, and classy woman. I have no children and am not planning to have any. I am looking for a serious, committed relationship. <br>
<br>
Please do not reply if: <br>
<br>
-- You drive 60-65 mph on a freeway when there is no traffic. I do not care what your reasons are. <br>
<br>
-- You are married or otherwise involved with someone. I am not interested in married or involved with someone men. It will take me just few minutes to figure out if you are married or involved with someone. Do not waste your and my time. <br>
<br>
-- You are emotionally unavailable.<br>
<br>
-- You are younger than 49 years old and older than 56 years old. <br>
<br>

I am looking for a man, 49 - 56 years old, who was either born in Europe and raised in Europe or has been raised by European parents or at least lived in Europe. I am looking for my life partner. I am looking for somebody to do things with, to cry with, to laugh with, talk with, travel with, take care of each other, etc. <br>
<br>

San Francisco is like a dream sometimes. It's not a place to be alone forever, I want to share it. I have friends, a cool job which I like, I go to art openings and rock shows and grand events...<br>
<br>
I write in my spare time, play guitar, do yoga, go to mountain retreats, spend time with friends, family. I am 5'2" tall with reddish brown longish curly hair. I am of Irish/French/Scottish descent from the Deep South. I transplanted here long ago, but I still carry my Southern Charms...I am in my 40's, but I am told I look a bit younger. I have have a healthy past & present. I can make a great Gumbo!<br>
<br>
I can appreciate excitement as well as stillness. I value intensity and intelligence as well as honesty and loyalty. I give as good as I get.<br>
<br>
You are a techie or engineer, a smart man with a sense of humor and a sense of style. As good looking as I am, to match. An artist at heart with ambition and courage. Someone who is excited about life and wants to make the best of this crazy time we live in whatever is to come.<br>

It only takes one. I will know by you by your kiss.<br>

Hello fellas I am trying to find me a wedding date that leads to something long term. My friends wedding is coming and the guy I was dating started acting up so I let him go. A little about me firstly I am full figured a lot of men don't like it but plenty do. I am independent, caring, fun, have my own place and as I am told all the time "I am wise beyond my years" which is good. What I like is a man that is real, caring, a gentleman and a non smoker/drinker. He must work and have no children (like me). I would prefer someone outside of my race (I'm black by the way). Please be American (born in the US) but any race, height, weight is alright. Age minimum is 23. If your interested let talk. Your picture gets mine.

Thanks for clicking on my post.<br>
I will keep it simple:<br>
Looking for someone with a past but has his eyes on the future. Someone that has lived and learned yet is always up for an adventure whether it be a trip to the grocery store or a camping trip in the mountains. Someone who has kids and understands that date night might just be a pizza and movie at home would be ideal. Friends first is a requirement. Someone who understands that alone time is just as important as couple time, no one wants to be smothered 24/7, yes I agree you need poker night with the boys as much as I need girl's night out, trust and respect for one another is of huge importance to me.<br>
I am no model but I am working on that give me time. :-)  I am on the shorter side of the height chart.<br>
Want to know more email me. <br>
Good luck in your search for ultimate happiness!!<br>

Hello there. If you are consistent, reliable, who communicates regularly and express your feelings, blue eyes, 5'10 to 6', well educated, well traveled, respectful gentleman, not jealous, intelligent, not possessive, not obsessive, with integrity and not superficial, honest, selfless and generous, with a good job and secure, between 49 to 60, good heart, cultured, faithful to his woman, divorced or single, family oriented, trustworthy, sincere, admirable, clean inside and outside, generous and again a gentleman please contact me.<br>
<br>
I am all of above, with a difference that I am a woman. I like to feel live again. I am divorced for several years. Finally I decided to look for that "special" man of my life to grow old with. I am looking for someone only in Marin.<br>
<br>
There is only one thing about me that you might not like. I smoke cigarettes since I was 14 years old and if this would be  a problem for you please do not contact me or e-mail me nasty notes. Cigarette smoking does not make me of a bad person. It is in my culture.<br>
<br>
Please include the most recent, clear picture of you and your life story. If we cannot be compatible as a couple we might become good friends.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,

Hello there. If you are consistent, reliable, who communicates regularly and express your feelings, blue eyes, 5'10 to 6', well educated, well traveled, respectful gentleman, not jealous, intelligent, not possessive, not obsessive, with integrity and not superficial, honest, selfless and generous, with a good job and secure, between 49 to 60, good heart, cultured, faithful to his woman, divorced or single, family oriented, trustworthy, sincere, admirable, clean inside and outside, generous and again a gentleman please contact me.<br>
<br>
I am all of above, with a difference that I am a woman. I like to feel live again. I am divorced for several years. Finally I decided to look for that "special" man of my life to grow old with. I am looking for someone only in Marin.<br>
<br>
There is only one thing about me that you might not like. I smoke cigarettes since I was 14 years old and if this would be  a problem for you please do not contact me or e-mail me nasty notes. Cigarette smoking does not make me of a bad person. It is in my culture.<br>
<br>
Please include the most recent, clear picture of you and your life story. If we cannot be compatible as a couple we might become good friends.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,

Hello,<br>
I am looking for a live together relationship. No drama. I take care of you and the home, cooking etc. and in exchange you take care of me. I want to be walking on the beach hand in hand when we are 80 (or sooner). I love to cook, hang out and watch movies, laugh and just have fun with someone, I admire and respect and hopefully grow to love. If this sounds like something you might like too, please reply. If you are not serious please don't reply...

So I'm a bit of a contradiction, and so are you.  I'm a successful professional, grounded and connected to a great tribe of people.  On the exterior, I'm petite, with long black hair and on the upside of attractive (in case that matters).  But I'm a rebel at heart.  Discomfort is underrated as it's required for exploring the world and being surprised.  So trudging about on foot in the city or abroad are things that I have to do. But I still love a great dining experience with a reason to put on high heels and lipstick.  Then again, hanging at a dive bar and watching the 49ers is a little slice of heaven.<br>
<br>
I'm looking to do all of this and more with someone who "gets it" and is a bit of a contraction...a rebel at heart too.

Hi!  I am a Chinese woman recently divorced.  5'5" tall and weight 148lbs.  Pleasant and charming looking.  Plus a pure heart.

There are so many great places to visit, adventures to experience, people to meet and things to do that I look forward to enjoying every minute of every day. I enjoy traveling and discovering the major cities (and country side) around the world. I've been to Paris, London, Rome, Venice, Barcelona, Singapore, and Hong Kong... My favorite activity in each city is to take a walk early in the morning. Every city 'wakes up' differently, try it next time. My favorite cities are still Paris and San Francisco, what about you?<br>
<br>
I have a beautiful daughter who has taught me unconditional love and is the nurturer of my soul. I love to cook and hang out with friends. I am very affable and personable, I enjoy having open and frank conversation with my closest friends; I prefer one on one conversation and connecting with people in a meaningful way. I also need a lot of alone time to recharge my energy. I love to drive and am very passionate about sport cars. I have recently taken up cycling, preferably riding up the hills than descending them. There is absolutely nothing like riding the east bay hills to clear the cobwebs of the day.<br>
<br>
A person who shares the same interests and values would be paramount to the ideal relationship. I like a man who is smart, confident but not cocky, independent, well-mannered, passionate, respectful and kind. He needs to be open-minded and has a positive outlook on life. Life is always filled with adversities; people who are optimistic and resilient tend to recover much more quickly when faced with challenges. He knows how to lead, yet know how to give you what you want. He is decisive and is willing to engage in tough conversation. He is affectionate, authentic and is genuinely nice to everyone. He has to be spontaneous, adventurous with a playful side.I am looking for my best friend, confidant and lover. Looking to share with that special someone what life has to offer whether it traveling to some place near or far, cooking a romantic dinner together, sharing a bottle of wine, going to the museum or just exploring new adventures.<br>
<br>
"Soul-mates are not found...they're made"...it is our intentions and actions that lead to a successful relationship....I feel that fate puts us in situations (whether it be CL or Peet's coffee) and what we do from there is up to us.<br>
<br>
If this is worth a coffee or a drink, send me a note and let's start a conversation. <br>

SWF, 5'8" 120lbs - Brown/Hazel.<br>
<br>
I find it important to balance levity and intensity in my life. My sense of humor brings fast friends while also easing difficult situations. I have a strong personality, and whereas California is home now for almost two decades, I'm still very much an East Coaster; direct,  and to the point. I should add that I also have a benevolent heart, a warm touch, an intrepid spirit, and live very comfortably in this body.  I have few material wants. I treasure experience over everything.<br>
<br>
Whereas my career doesn't define me, it speaks of my values and priorities.  I grew up in a progressive household where giving back was a way of life, not simply a good lesson to impart upon your children. I work with low-income children and families, and I am constantly impressed by the candor and resiliency of my young clients. I love the work I've chosen to do, and laughed out loud when one of my second grade clients told his younger sister, "You need to be in second grade and have issues to see Ms. V..." <br>
<br>
I danced professionally when I was younger, so I need to be in motion. I still take class and attend performances regularly. It is not essential that you're a great dancer, but getting up, and knowing how to have fun with your body while engaging in complete abandon is important. Your salary and vocation are not.  <br>
<br>
I am very feminine, and clean up nicely, but I am not a girly girl. I find shopping about as enjoyable as giving blood.  I  love cooking, and easily spend hours at cheese shops, the farmers' market, Tartine, Farine, on Clement Street, etc. Cooking is not just about eating, it's a sensuous experience and I enjoy the process and hosting dinner parties.  A few favorite spots are Camino, A Cote, Citron, Burma Super Star, and Arizmendi for their chocolate scones. I believe the words non-fat are fighting words, and I don't like to fight.  <br>
<br>
You stand up for what you believe in, even if it means getting in "trouble." You appreciate simplicity over extravagant excess. You define integrity on a daily basis. You are playful and affectionate. You are intellectually curious. You like to read aloud. You know when to lead and when to follow. You're in my corner (even when you don't want to be). You have a well-developed social conscience. You know how to turn yourself inside out for the one you love. You understand that lasting relationships require daily watering, and have done some work on yourself. You accept that we're both imperfect, and believe in second chances, and working on the hard stuff. You are insatiably curious. You revel in your partner's triumphs, and know that I'm always going to be your biggest fan. You make an effort to take care of both mind and body, and live an active life.<br>

Please be 41-52 and within 25 miles of Oakland. Your photo gets mine. Photos without text will be deleted.

Feeling nostalgic, I remember what it was like to be in a good relationship. A partnership of sorts. I'm happiest when everyone around me is also. <br>
I work, part time, I have free time for someone special in my life. I speak english, and spanish. Most of the music I listen to and sing along with is in spanish. <br>
It's a romance language, and I love learning more and more.  Tell me about you, if you'd like to maybe get together tomorrow night for an early dinner and conversation. <br>
<br>
I'm full figured and blonde. I have green eyes, and  I think I'm attractive for someone my age. <br>

Happy Holidays, I hope you'll think about spending some of this season with someone special. <br>

I want to keep this simple, since a lengthy ad would most likely be skimmed through.<br>
<br>
I am looking for a friend to start, and if there is chemistry perhaps more. He would be someone like me - fit, healthy, attractive, smart, curious, left-leaning, happy, animal lover, outdoorsy.<br>
<br>
I am an educated professional, young and feminine looking. No kids but love them. I don't consider myself picky but like everyone else, I click with some and not others. So lets exchange photos and go from there.

Hi, <br>
<br>
I'm a DWF with an elementary school-aged son who lives with me half-time. I'm a successful creative professional who has also started and run a non-profit. I'm world-traveled but with my roots in the Bay Area. I'm seeking a dear friend and partner,  someone who appreciates intellectual and emotional depth in a compact package (I'm 5'5" -- 105lbs). <br>
<br>
You are (45-59) with a big brain and heart, a wonderfully active intellectual appetite and curiosity and a fit body. You are someone who would enjoy sharing a hike, an interesting adventure out in the world or an evening at home making dinner alone or with  friends. You are cosmopolitan but unpretentious. You get satisfaction from your work and are established professionally but also value intimacy and being in a steady relationship. <br>
<br>
<br>
 If this sounds inviting, I might just be the playmate with whom you can share adventures and your heart. I look forward to hearing from you and would appreciate a photo (mine sent back) as part of an introduction of yourself.

Izzit the wrong time to post here looking for an entertaining companion? Probably. <br>
Holiday frenzy aside, there are the famous seasonal depressions coupled with a seeming<br>
impossibility to accomplish anything for the next month or so. <br>
<br>
Conversely, it's slightly out of real time now. The second hand loses momentum, and<br>
personal lives we never suspected among people we know slightly come to light. <br>
We are more receptive, more aware of one another, more interested in the lives behind <br>
the usual interactions. <br>
<br>
So perhaps its a good time to extend a hand, to look afresh, and to imagine an intense<br>
new friendship with a companionable man. <br>
<br>
Devastating intellect, dashing good looks, and astonishing wit would be welcome. <br>
More important, though, are good nature, consideration, moderate erudition, and <br>
a great sense of humor, as well as Availability!<br>
<br>
As for me, fully employed designer, 5'-6", hwp, mid 50's, mildly decorative, semi-attached. <br>
A great tour guide and entertaining companion.

Ready set go! :) meaning... I am truly ready to meet a great guy. Are you ready to meet a great woman? Your intent is a relationship? I am in no rush, but intent is important! If you seek an extramarital fling, a hookup etc, i am not that woman. <br>
<br>
Why am i that great gal? Well, i am fun, easy going, have my act together with a professional life, can be easy to please, find adoring my partner a natural trait in me. I am pretty, curvier than average, with pretty eyes and a great smile. I am tall at 5'8", smart, travelled, but not stuffy at all! I am friendly, easy to talk to, warm and caring. <br>
<br>
Please don't bother with one line emails or expecting a picture without any emails. I have pics, but would like to know a bit about you before i send one! Ages 39 to 49, taller than me, a white collar profession, attractive and ready :) i do prefer white, hispanic and european men.<br>
<br>
Best, me

Just what the title says, I'm a BBW looking for a single, white male. I am NOT looking for FWB. Please be between the ages of 27 and 40. Married men need not apply, nor those who are not white and aren't in that age range. Also please be somewhat close in distance. It's cold out and I'm bored and lonely on this Friday night, so I'd like to find some friends to chat with, see if there's a connection. Please put the word "flowers" in the subject line so I know you're not spam. Your pic gets mine. Thanks!

I'm looking for a godly man. I know it seems crazy to be looking here. But you just never know. I'm looking for a long term relationship with the end goal marriage and family. Not looking for a booty call, one night stand or a fling. I'm looking for something meaningful. About me: I am a 33 year old Mexican with no kids. I have brown curly hair and brown eyes. I have some unwanted baggage that I'm working on losing. I live a Christian life. I'm honest, loyal, compassionate, caring, hard worker and have a strong desire to be a wife and mother one day. But I'm in no rush to find the perfect man. I have a great job that I love and pay my own bills. I'm very much sane and drama free. Hobbies included cooking, reading, swimming, and hanging out with family and friends. I have many goals and dreams and hope you do to.<br>
<br>
You should have the same characteristics and family goals as I do. I've been attracted to Mexican, African American and Pacific Islanders in the past. Help encourage and be my work out buddy. Live relatively close to San Jose. <br>
<br>
Deal breakers: Must be between the ages of 32-40 years old. Height 5'6 or taller. Christian and seeking marriage and family.- Sorry.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time, if interested please reply, tell me about yourself and what your looking for. Please type "San Jose" in the subject so I know your real. Please also include a recent photo.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your search. Hope to talk to you soon.<br>

I'm into simple pleasures: sunsets, star gazing, pool (I play badly), movies, silence, cuddling, kayaking, laughing, dancing, international food. Would love to try paddle boarding and zip-lining at Kirkwood and on Maui.<br>

I have an adventurous side I'd like to share with someone special, as well as the quiet, DVD night in. Tickling, wrestling, laughing until I cry, too. ;-)<br>

Hello Craigslister,<br>
<br>
I am writing this on behalf of a friend who is apprehensive about using craigslist.   She is attractive,  enjoys reading, and is one of the smartest people I know (and I know a lot of smart people).<br>
<br>
She is a 20-something female, interested in someone who is tall, reasonably well off (or with earnings potential in the near future), intelligent, vegan (or vegetarian and vegan-friendly), and preferably employed in a technical field. <br>

I am tired of the games men play these days. Its either one or the other. You want me or you don't simple as that. I am a straight forward woman, I don't play games unless I'm playing the wii with my nieces and nephews. I take my relationships seriously because they mean a lot to me. I am hardworking and real and would like someone the same. I have no problem with dating men of other races however if you don't speak proper English it's probably not going to work out well. I am black and full figured if that's not your cup of tea, then don't drink it. You must be over the age of 24. I'm fun, single childless and would like to be in a real long term relationship with someone who is the same so if your interested then lets talk. :-)

I am seeking no perfect man. I am not very picky however I do have some general standards and those are. You must be 22 and older and very mature because where I am in my life I am mature and ready to live life with someone who has much life experience. In a way I want to settle down with someone who wants to settle down with me. You must also be a working man for I am a working woman, and no children are a plus (too many issues with men with them).<br>
<br>
Race, height, weight and all that doesn't matter either for I have had many different men from all walks races and looks of life and have found each experience to be different. Also a plus with me if your settled in your life looking for someone to share it with. I am a full time business/busy woman, black and a bigger girl. If this what your looking for then you know what to do.<br>

I am looking for a potential long term relationship, fulltime relationship with a emotionally mature man, not looking for a hookup or casual dating or a friend.  Single or divorced, US born Asian or Caucausian man, mid 30-40's.  Lives a clean healthy, lifestyle, financially stable, job, kind, in shape, self esteem and reliable.  Non smoking, no drinking, no drugs and no kids.<br>
<br>
Can offer you a stable, sane, career orientated, loyal, monogamous, caring, positive, single asian woman, US born who doesn't have any drug, drinking, kid or emotional issues.  I am pretty girlie, not into motorcycles, tattoos, sports and roughing it.  Enjoy live theater, musicals, art galleries, travel, both domestic and international, independent and blockbuster films, dancing, cruises, spaing and even quiet weekends at home.<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read my CL ad.  It is a challenge to find someone who thinks you are attractive and you find attractive too. Missed connections because there wasn't attraction on my part or theirs.  If interested, please send a photo and a response.  Thanks again!<br>

In my opinion, December & January are great months for the best movies, wonderful concerts, ballet, special events, holiday parties, discussing books, checking out the beautifully decorated homes and businesses throughout the Bay Area, and the list is endless. Looking for a SWM 65-78 who would enjoy some of these activities and might even be available to do something Christmas Day. I am a very friendly, happy, attractive, intelligent, healthy, honest, outgoing SWF who would also be interested in travel outside the area in 2012 if we found we got on very well and had common places to see.  P.S. I don't limit myself to the East Bay.

Afternoon! It's a beautiful day outside!<br>
<br>
I'm new to the area, and am looking for someone to help show me around and enjoy all the sights and sounds. Maybe if we get along, we can keep hanging out? Not necessarily looking for a serious relationship just yet, just something fun and simple. You never know though. I find it difficult to meet and get to know people in the bar environment, so I figured I'd try this out. :)<br>
<br>
I love to laugh, dress up for nights out, cook, travel, try new restaurants, go to live concerts, drink wine, hike, play and watch sports, talk nerd, watch movies, and many other things!<br>
<br>
For specifics, I am 5'8", white, auburn hair, educated, employed, independent, and am curvy in the right places. If you're looking for someone petite and skinny, I'm not your girl. <br>
<br>
I will like you if you make me laugh, know what you want (confidence is key), are not gangster, are taller than me, and try to take care of your body.<br>
<br>
Let me know a little about yourself, and we'll see how things go. <br>

Hi I am not good with this CL stuff but I will just be straight forward. Men 25-40 I am looking for a nice intelligent man. I like going to art galleries, trips to Tahoe, going on retreats, dinner and a movie or just going bowling. I work a nice job and I live alone, have no children and don't want any until the future. So I seek a man with NO CHILDREN, who is a non smoker/drinker, who works and likes full figured women. Someone who wants to do more than just lay around the house all day but actually want to do something with his self. Prefer you are born in America but any race doesn't matter. I am black down to earth, very lady like, mannerly and love to have fun. If any man find this ad interesting then lets move forward! Enjoy your evening. (Your picture will get mines)

Thought I'd try posting and see what's out here. I'm currently doing a program of intensive study, which is a bit of social life killer. I'm looking for a down to earth guy with a sense of adventure to get to know better. Not seeking the next love of my life, just someone to spend time with in a casual way. <br>
<br>
I'm interested in film noir, urban fashion, going to see live music of all types, gardening, ethnic food, going for walks,  and getting into trouble. I'm easy to get along with, very nice, and ambitious. Physically, I'm a fit, leggy brunette with dark eyes. Your picture gets mine.<br>

If this sounds at all desirable, write to me. <br>
Put "wink" as the subject so I know you're real.

I am looking for a a wonderful man who is seriously ready and interested in dating a wonderful woman. Every good relationship starts as a friendship first but ultimately I want the whole package - a meaningful relationship with a man of substance - because I am definitely a woman of substance. A little about me - I love all types of music (with the exception of rap) from opera to classical, from jazz to rock. I love to read and enjoy a good story whether fiction or non-fiction, I love to laugh and I am a very happy person content with my life. I also like a walk by the beach, a romantic dinner. . . I definitely want to see the world and travel more. I'm a very warm and loving person with a passion for life and for the people I love and especially for the man in my life. Kindness, and good sense of self is very important. I will give as good as I get - if not even more! Don't think about sex only, not my style. I love to be cuddled and spoiled with lots of love and genuine friendship and you will be treated the same. I am of Mediterranean background with black hair and lots of curls and waves. The eyes seem to have it for me - so I'm told. And trust me, you will see much in them - from desire and passion to warmth and caring to gracious and appreciative. But they are brown in color. I'm a medium size woman, with curves in all the right places and though beauty is in the eyes of the beholder - I get my fair share of looks. I want a man who is settled emotionally with no baggage from ex's and with a very comfortable financial situation so we can both enjoy the kind of life I imagine we will want to share together. I bring very little debt or baggage to the table so I want my match in this regard and I want to continue with a nice lifestyle or nicer! I am a very direct person who talks straight to the point so no picture, no reply unless you write something so amazing that just sweeps me off my feet. Which I would love! Your picture will get mine if we have mutual interest. Please be on the taller side as I am 5'7" and with heels....well, I do enjoy a tall man. A nice to have - not a deal breaker. Please no younger than 47/48 years old and no older than 60 (and only then if you have a young spirit, attitude and looks).<br>
<br>
No games, no baggage and a really good woman who still believes YOU are out there. Forever a romantic that's for sure. And you?

Attractive single parent trying to date after a divorce.  I am very outgoing and friendly.  I am looking to meet new people and make new friends, but I put this in the LTR section as I am not opposed to developing something serious.  We can start with movies, food, drinks or an outdoor activity.  All sound fun to me.

If you like to give hugs, like to hear from you. Never hurts to be hugged.  I am  very easy to get along with. I also do enjoy going out for lunch or dinner and a movie. If you like comedy, big plus to me. If you are married, that is fine with me too. Enjoy an older mature man, the best for myself. Be respectful !

I'm looking for an honest, fun, single,  laid back, employed man.  A best friend, someone to love and be loved by.  I'm not a girly girl, love to be in my jeans and sneakers.  ok, so here are the strikes:. I am a bbw and I smoke, ciggs and 420.  <br>
<br>
I've dated a couple men in the past few months. They all say the right things, but I'm sorry...For me size does matter and I also prefer black men. I know you'll write and say give me a try, but I know what I like and want.<br>

Physically my dream man would be tall, over 6', broad shoulders, bald and a great smile. Weight does not really matter much to me, but fat on fat does not work well if you know what I mean. Are you out there somewhere?

Attractive professional black woman (mid 30s) -- I have been told that I'm funny (I think super funny), sarcastic, mean and nice, cute, beautiful, sweet and tart, intelligent, sometimes a smartass but pretty much always a super cool chick. The most baggage and drama I have is my needing to mow the lawn in my backyard and prune my trees (it's really bad) -- so drama free is definitely a must.<br>
<br>
I would be great to meet a fun, interesting, little quirky, open minded, creative and nice to look at guy (Asian, white, black, Latin, etcetera--race doesn't matter especially if you're super cute and funny). This guy is also in his early 30s to early 40s, and wants to just get out and do stuff (museums, bars, art, new restaurants, music, movies, outdoor stuff, festivals, pretty much whatever). . . <br>

Soo, long story short, if you are up to make a new friend or someone to shoot the breeze with I would love to hear from you. Not looking for a bootie call or hook up (that's way too easy), but someone to spend time, have fun with and enjoying each other's company while not taking things too seriously and just see what happens. <br>
<br>
Please include a picture and statistics --height, age, etc so I know who I am talking to (I will gladly send a picture if I feel there is a connection after I have received yours)... <br>

Attractive professional black woman (mid 30s) -- I have been told that I'm funny (I think super funny), sarcastic, mean and nice, cute, beautiful, sweet and tart, intelligent, sometimes a smartass but pretty much always a super cool chick. The most baggage and drama I have is my needing to mow the lawn in my backyard and prune my trees (it's really bad) -- so drama free is definitely a must.<br>
<br>
I would be great to meet a fun, interesting, little quirky, open minded, creative and nice to look at guy (Asian, white, black, Latin, etcetera--race doesn't matter especially if you're super cute and funny). This guy is also in his early 30s to early 40s, and wants to just get out and do stuff (museums, bars, art, new restaurants, music, movies, outdoor stuff, festivals, pretty much whatever). . . <br>
