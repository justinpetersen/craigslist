You may have a unique and beautiful instrument, but if you have never been taught how to use your diaphragm to support your voice, how to place the air in your mouth and release a steady even breath, the correct positioning of the tongue mouth and jaw, then you may often sound off pitch, and you might be straining your voice, and it may even hurt to sing.<br>

Stop notes from wavering, cracking, and going flat or sharp with a steady, even breath placed correctly in your palette. Understand the four major components to great singing: Support, Placement, Position & Ear Training. <br>

If you just wanna meet up with some good people, throw back a few beers, and play some good music then reply to this post.  I'm a guitarist/singer (been playing guitar about 15 years, singing for about 6) and am dieing to just get some people together for a quality jam session.  We can get a few people together and split a studio for a day (about 60 bucks) where they supply all the equipment we would need.  So, if you play something (bass, keys, drums, mandolin, whatever) hit me up and we can do something up.

Tumbao plays vintage jazz tunes upheld with Afro Latin Rhythms as well as Samba Beats. Sounds like 1950' s into 1970's era. Will create a great time vibe for all and kids really enjoy this band. EMail for MP3 samples<br>

We are currently a drummer and guitarist looking to start collaborating with a vocalist for a new metal band.  We both have all pro gear and have played in several bay area bands.  We are looking for someone who can sing as well as scream, so if you can't do one or the other, please do not waste our time or yours.  Some of our influences include but are not limited to: Trivium, All That Remains, In Flames, Bullet For My Valentine, Atreyu, Shadows Fall, Lamb Of God, Killswitch Engage, to name a few.  We are currently working on new material, so we're looking to get someone ASAP.  You must have reliable transportation and be able to practice a couple times a week.

Greetings! I'm Bob Danielson and I've been teaching drummers since 1980. I've also maintained a succesful professional career playing a wide variety of music since 1974. For 15 years, 1990 to 2005, I was the Principal Drummer at world famous Beach Blanket Babylon. Here's what I bring to your lesson. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*Teaching since 1980 local and international drummers. <br>
<br>
*34+ years performing, recording, touring; America, Japan, Britain. <br>
<br>
*Clinician-Guitar Center and drum World in SF. <br>
<br>
*Author-Modern Drummer and Rhythm magzines. <br>
<br>
*Judge for SF high school JROTC drum corps and local music store drumoffs. <br>
<br>
*Masters Degree and faculty member Mt. Diablo College. <br>
<br>
*BA Music, University of California, Davis. <br>
<br>
*Member of Vic Firth international team of drum set educators. <br>
<br>
*A genuine enthusiasm for coaching drummers, no matter what their skill level. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Studio <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*Spacious, clean, all about music. <br>
<br>
*2 drum sets. <br>
<br>
*The technological and audio equipment to enhance your lesson. <br>
<br>
*Yamaha U3 piano. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm experienced with all ages and levels of ability. Many of my younger students play in some of San Francisco's most prestigious High School and Middle School bands:School of the Arts, St. Ignatius, Lowell, Lick Wilmerding, Hoover, and Aptos to name a few. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
References, ranging from professional drummers, school band directors, and parents, are available upon request. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Our son has taken percussion with Bob for five years and we are convinced he is the best technique and theory teacher. Our son is now studying percussion at Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan and at his audition the instructor commented on his great skills and musicality...thanks to Bob. Our son is always a step ahead and I believe that is in part due to Bob's teaching." <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I encourage you to take advantage of a free 15 minute consultation with me at the studio. Meeting in person is the best way to determine if the student/teacher chemistry is right. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bright Moments, <br>
<br>
<br>

I have years of experience playing guitar, including shows and studio work so i am down to either fill in for shows or studio work or in the right situation join full time. Now i had to sell my drums to move out here but if you have a set i can play on i can play drums just as well. I was in a tool cover band and wrote tons of original material and if i found the right situation sure id buy my own drums again. Same thing can do it for shows/studio work/permanent member. <br>
<br>
Music is my life and moved out to the bay for it so i do want to join a permanent band and tour and record and make it my life,but also just want to play in the meantime. I am very reliable, not flaky and will be straight up if i dont think its a fit. <br>
<br>
So if youre looking for a guitar player or drummer for permanancy, fill in for shows, studio work or whatever hit me up.

I'm looking to form a band to play some indie/folk rock music..... I"m an acoustic guitarist looking for another guitarist, singer, drummer, and any other musician that can play a different instrument that can complete the band you don't have to be an expert playing your instrument but decent enough to play along with other musicians.... I'm looking for musician between the ages of 19 - 25 m/f who can commit to the band and give if their all. I'm open to play other styles of music as long as it sound good. Some of the bands i listen too are silversun pickups, the dodos, the shins, the kooks, bowerbirds, the morning benders, seasick steve, bob dylan, mumford & sons, johnny flynn, arcade fire, the black lips, the temper trap, the black keys hope that gives an idea of what I'm looking for.

<big><b>Tabla Lessons / Performance</b>

<p>Tabla player available for lessons or performance.

<p>I teach classical, folk styles or tabla as a general percussion instrument, according to your interests. I have many years of teaching experience with all types of students. Beginners, 'non-musicians', children and adults are all welcome. My teaching style emphasizes rhythm, tone and musicality. This allows for a rewarding experience of your instrument even as a beginner. 
More advanced students will find that my unique approach can open new ways of understanding and feeling rhythm.

<p>I have been studying tabla since 1995 and am currently studying under tabla master Swapan Chaudhuri.

<p>Lessons are at my house in the North Berkeley Hills. Scheduling is flexible according to your needs.

<p>For more information or to schedule a lesson contact David Aue at:  510-541-8988   or   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/muc/mailto:tabla@aue.org?subject=Tabla%20Lessons">tabla@aue.org</a>

Electronic musician and/or Keyboard player    twin peaks/diamond hts<br>
<br>
Rock based band looking to add strong electronic elements/composition. <br>
We are looking for an Effects/textured based electronic computer musician and/or keyboard/synth/pianist <br>
<br>
Our goal is to blend rich vocal harmonies, and acoustic instruments with abstract sound design. We are interested in creating songs that have interesting structures, and evolving parts, with an emphasis on dynamics. The ability to switch between soft acoustic stuff, then noise-y more challenging material. <br>
<br>
We are a band that is striving for success in that we do want to tour/record as our CAREERS. If this bothers you please do not respond. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our influences include: <br>
<br>
Deerhunter, Elliott Smith, Caribou, Radiohead, the Beatles, Dr. Dog, Grizzly Bear, Neil young, CSN&Y, the Byrds, Jimi Hendrix (Not heavy on guitar soloing though), Led Zeppelin (specifically Led Zeppelin III), Wilco <br>
<br>
Please include any relevant samples of your playing. We are serious about creating good music, that is our goal. I know that that may sound redundant because everyone wants to do that, however we feel it truly takes hard work and time to achieve this. <br>

<br>
We are a band that is striving for success in that we do want to tour/record as our CAREERS. If this bothers you please do not respond. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our influences include: <br>
<br>
Deerhunter, Elliott Smith, Caribou, Radiohead, the Beatles, Dr. Dog, Grizzly Bear, Neil young, CSN&Y, the Byrds, Jimi Hendrix (Not heavy on guitar soloing though), Led Zeppelin (specifically Led Zeppelin III), Wilco <br>
<br>
Please include any relevant samples of your playing. We are serious about creating good music, that is our goal. I know that that may sound redundant because everyone wants to do that, however we feel it truly takes hard work and time to achieve this. <br>

I am a songwriter that dabbles in some guitar playing and am looking to jam with talented young (18-23) musicians. I like to play classic rock, punk, alternative, blues and jazz.

FUNKIN' GROOVIN' BASS PLAYER NEEDED - VALLEJO AREA DANCE/PARTY BAND <br>
<br>
Who We Are: <br>
Serious musicians from the East Bay (ages from 41-51) consisting of Keyboards, Guitar, and Drums, and yes, we all sing. We practice in the Vallejo area, and have a complete PA system. (However, if you have one, and a place to practice, that's a bonus, however not required!) Our 3 members are seasoned veterans who have worked in established "gigging" bands. We've played the hottest venues with the best musicians around, and we are NO means a garage band. We are quick learners, and are committed in finding a bass player that can learn just as fast. Our goal is to start gigging by early summer. <br>
<br>
What We Play:<br>
Anything to make a party DANCE! 70's, 80's, party rock, dance, funk, and ANYTHING YOU CAN BRING TO THE TABLE! <br>
<br>
What Tunes Specifically?<br>
"Lowdown" by Boz Skaggs, "Get Down Tonight" by KC and the Sunshine band, "Rock this Town" by the Stray Cats, "Superstitious" by Stevie Wonder, "Wonderful Tonight" by Eric Clapton, "Black Magic Woman" by Santana, "Spooky" by the Atlanta Rhythm Section, and tons more! <br>
<br>
What we are looking for in a BASS player:<br>
We are looking for a seasoned pro with professional equipment, a fantastic attitude, GROOVE AND FEEL to lock in with the drummer, a good ear and the ability to "get the changes", the time to rehearse (once a week), and a POSITIVE player who can have fun on stage. VOCALS ARE A MUST, LEAD AND BACKGROUND! <br>
<br>
How often do we want to gig?<br>
A few Fridays or Saturdays a month. This band is NOT a full time venture and could be some nice supplemental income. You will NOT have to quit your full time job or alter your schedule severely to make time to practice or gig.<br>
<br>
<br>
**THIS IS IMPORTANT!!** <br>
If you can't be committed to an audition and rehearsing...this band is not for you. If you have other projects on the side , please don't waste our time nor yours. If there is ANY INTENTION of possibly flaking out, we are not interested! We want a great bass player willing to do what it takes to make our band GO, WE DON'T WANT EXCUSES WHY YOU CAN'T DO IT!<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.... <br>
If you are an accomplished bassist, and preferably vocalist, and have the time, the talent, the commitment, and the drive to be a part of a WORKING organization with good people, great players, and LOTS of heart, THIS COULD BE THE BAND YOU HAVE DREAMED OF!<br>
<br>
So....Is This YOU??<br>
Serious inquiries only, please email us anything and everything about you, and how we can contact you!

Need Upright or Electric Bass tracks?  <br>
<br>
Is your album or demo missing some quality bass playing? I play both Upright and electric bass, and I love to record and play good music. My rates are extremely reasonable. And, I have a great collection of basses. <br>
Contact me for more details. Thanks! <br>

So, everything was rocking along. We found a kick-ass drummer. Got a sweet deal on a 24-hour practice spot. Got a nice PA and mixer. Started playing some shows and having a blast...then the drummer had to bail due to work obligations. Oh no!<br>
<br>
Now we need a drummer. Possibly you?<br>
<br>
Here is a rundown. We started as a cover band so that we could get used to playing with each other and so we could quickly start booking shows. We have a set entirely from the band Millencolin. We can bang that out and have a good time with it. Getting shows is no problem, we could probably play every week if we wanted to.<br>
<br>
If you're not familiar with Millencolin you should check them out and see if you would want to run that set for a little while until we get our own material written. (Songs: Kemp, Penguins & Polar Bears, No Cigar, Afghan, Ray, Fox)<br>
<br>
A heaver sound with double bass would be fine, actually preferred. I like to go open D tuning. Please understand dynamics. Know when it's appropriate to let off the gas and when it's time to blow everyone away.<br>
<br>
We have everything but the drummer. We are 420 friendly and go through a few brews every practice, but we are all serious about the band and are really trying to make this work.

If you're not familiar with Millencolin you should check them out and see if you would want to run that set for a little while until we get our own material written. (Songs: Kemp, Penguins & Polar Bears, No Cigar, Afghan, Ray, Fox)<br>
<br>
A heaver sound with double bass would be fine, actually preferred. I like to go open D tuning. Please understand dynamics. Know when it's appropriate to let off the gas and when it's time to blow everyone away.<br>
<br>
We have everything but the drummer. We are 420 friendly and go through a few brews every practice, but we are all serious about the band and are really trying to make this work.

Attention string players!<br>
<br>
I'm a violinist seeking a violist and additional violinist to form a regularly-meeting string quartet. Aiming for a just-for-the-love-of-music sort of vibe, with musicians who are experienced and dedicated, without the ego that often goes along with it. We will likely come from a diverse musical background, and I just want to enjoy playing great music, rather than worry about who can who can play 32nd notes in 11th position more accurately.<br>
<br>
Not opposed to paid gigs (especially with the holiday gold mine upon us), and we can decide as a group how aggressively to go after such opportunities.<br>
<br>
Must have availability after 6 PM on weekdays, and the occasional weekend for gigs.

Tired of seeing acoustic acts play Brown Eyed Girl, Hotel California, and Fire and Rain? If you are looking for an awesome female singer and guitar player for your next party or event look no further. Toree McGee specializes in a wide range of current Top 40 songs from today and yesterday by leading artist like Beyonce, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, The Police, Katy Perry, Neon Trees, Pearl Jam, Train, Alanis, Carry Underwood, Janis Joplin, Sugarland, Brad Paisley, Zac Brown, Pink, No Doubt, and even Soundgarden, etc. From upbeat rock to country ballads, Toree delivers. And don't worry, she can play traditional songs by James Taylor, The Eagles, Elton John, and even Aerosmith, etc. She can entertain the most diverse crowd without the need to crank the volume, or have a formal stage, etc. Please take a listen to the Youtube clips at the following site listed below. This is how she will sound in your living room, backyard, wedding, coffee shop, hotel, golf course, winery, farmer's market, or outside street event. Toree is also interested in opening up for other well known touring bands. All songs are played with an acoustic guitar, through a great sounding 1400 watt PA system. Toree can accommodate all size venues, including locations without electrical power.  Thank you...<br>

 Hey what's up  I'm a drummer looking to get two guitar players for my band I have in the works.  I need one rhythm and one lead guitar player, whom preferably have their own equipment have experience in playing and writing can make it to practice on time and can play our style of music   melodic metalcore and or post hardcore along those lines of a sound, we play break downs and a lot of triplet's blast beast, slow and chunky riffs but not too slow. I currently have a bass player and a vocalist in line and ready to go I just need some guitars that are serious and dedicated to start something up. We play in Livermore about two to three times a week in my garage, sometimes on the weekends every other but mainly on the weekdays, we are opened minded to all opinions and ideas no egos open to both genders, ages around 20 -28 (just as a rough idea if your over no biggie if your under well still contact you it just might be hard to get you into bar shows and what not but we can always discuss that) if this sounds like something you're interested in then please let me know and we can pick a day to try out and see where it goes send me an email an ill get right back to you

Hello all! My name is Chris Kelly and I'm available to teach you how to play drums! I've been teaching at Summer Rock Camp for 5 years now and have started teaching drum lessons of my own. I am the drummer for the band, Jess and the Rabbis (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jesusandtherabbis.com">http://www.jesusandtherabbis.com</a>).  <br>
<br>
I will go over drum grooves, sticking patterns and technique. I will give you good insight on ways to improve your drumming. I teach at J ACE J studios (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jacejmusic.com/J_ACE_J_Music/Welcome.html">http://jacejmusic.com/J_ACE_J_Music/Welcome.html</a>)  in Redwood city. Just $40 for a 45 minute lesson or $30 for a 30 minute lesson. I'm available to teach on Wednesdays and Fridays.<br>
<br>
Thanks for you time and I look forward to hearing from you!

Finger-style guitarist/ multi-instrumentalist plays solo, duo, or with a band for your party, gathering, wedding. The band (the JEDD Bros.) plays rock and roll with a fiddle (3 time state fiddle champion) and a banjo, along with guitar, bass and drums. I do a wide range of material and styles. Reasonable and professional. (I also play a number of retirement home and nursing home gigs). Check short clips of my originals from my cd, Rogue River Waltz, at my website, www.fieldmusic.net. Call Dave at 831-423-2154.

Finger-style guitarist/ multi-instrumentalist plays solo, duo, or with a band for your party, gathering, wedding. The band (the JEDD Bros.) plays rock and roll with a fiddle (3 time state fiddle champion) and a banjo, along with guitar, bass and drums. I do a wide range of material and styles. Reasonable and professional. (I also play a number of retirement home and nursing home gigs). Check short clips of my originals from my cd, Rogue River Waltz, at my website, www.fieldmusic.net. Call Dave at 831-423-2154.

Time to step up your groove? Let's do that.<br>
<br>
<br>
I love bass playing. The electric bass' role in modern music is just... well... "fun" for lack of a more sophisticated way of saying it. (IE Hip-Hop, all different kinds of Rock... Jazz and Jam/Fusion/Funk stuff...) The bass and stringed instruments in general are very visual. We think in riffs, not "now I'm playing the note C, now I'm playing E, now I'm playing C again" etc. The visual nature of the the bass (and guitar) offers us the ability to learn and play every major scale and its pentatonic variation at every position on the fretboard, without ever having to learn all those scales (and modes) as independent concepts. If you play a horn, there's nothing for it. You must learn them all independently. We don't play a horn.j<br>
<br>
<br>
You'll be surprised how easy it is to master "playing everything everywhere." For example you will never have to learn the Eb Maj scale as a new concept. (or Eb Dorian for that matter!!) We'll be thinking in terms of fingerings and riffs, and it is completely comprehensive, cutting no corners. I can have you playing up and down the neck in every key within a few lessons. How fast you'll be playing may depend greatly on current skill level. :) Books often tell you all about which scale has how many sharps and flats, trying to make you "think in piano" only then transferring it to the neck of your bass. Since we have a grid, not just a line of notes, we can learn to PLAY everything up front, coming at any further theory studies from the perspective of already being able to visualize the concept everywhere it occurs on our instrument.<br>
<br>
<br>
The nature of our fretboard allows us master the common scales, across all 4 strings, everywhere on the neck, without ever having to learn more than 7 fingerings and the note names on the 2 lowest strings. It's hard to explain, since it's a bass & guitar-specific concept very visual learning system. If you are a visual learner, then this will be particularly easy. With intermediate-advanced players, I encourage them to work on this system, so we can efficiently fill in the blanks on their current vision of the fretboard.<br>
 <br>
It's a new ballgame when you can play a groove in any key anywhere on the neck as well as do harmonic analysis of other players' bass lines. You'll be surprised how fast we can get there, especially if you are an advanced player. So, we can get you seeing everything that's available to you on the fretboard pretty fast. Then you have to figure out what to play, which I will address now. I also like to emphasize "feel" and tone, since how we play the notes is very important on bass. Concepts like ghost notes and palm-muting let us make a lot of interesting sounds within a normal melodic phrase/bass part. This is where I can help any level of player, including complete beginners. With beginners, I place less emphasis on scales and more on just mastering basic movements. Then we will organically arrive at a place where you'll need to learn scales and understand basic theory. With more advanced players, I try to help break any bad technique habits that are hindering your progress and find some target riffs and exercises that address specific things we want to try to add to your skill set, along with any theory/scale work we're doing.<br>
 <br>
I emphasize learning tasteful "lyrical" bass playing, trying to make your own bass lines into "hooks," when the song presents you an opportunity to do so. We want to really play a part in the band, not just be the kick drum buddy. In hip-hop, the bass is often the center of the melodic groove, as far as real instruments go.... for example Ron Carter's playing on Tribe Called Quest "Low End Theory." He played upright bass on every track, doing a lot more than taking the bass player's typical, simpler roll in Hip-Hop track.... Another example would be how Mowtown legend James Jamerson approached a typical baseline, as opposed to his contemporaries. The guy wrote great bass lines. (I'm not saying that only flashy bass playing is good. It totally depends on what you're playing. Sometimes we do just have to go "root, root, root, root, 1, 2, 3, 4," U2/Coldplay style.)<br>
   <br>
Whatever style(s) you're into, we can find something at your skill level to work on. Mastering the fretboard is key, but it just tells us what I often refer to as "the dance steps." Then we have to dance. We want to learn the steps, then dance... working in small sections and really finishing as you go. We can work on playing, technique, and chops and/or branch out into scales and music theory. Every student that comes to me has unique needs/interests. I try to help them build the skill set they'll need to play their favorite genres. When we do address mastering scales and theory, it will be with an emphasis on learning what you actually need to play for your band, project, tatste, vibe...<br>
 <br>
Some of my favorite bassists and influences include... well.. Ron Carter and James Jamerson, as mentioned above.... Chris Wood, Mingus, Jaco, Collin Greenwood, Victor Wooten, and Cliff Burton. My listening tastes are clearly all over the place, even if most of those guys are in some style of "mellow" music. I like to rock out too. I have a BA in music. I've been a bass teacher for about 10 years and a bassist for over 25. Aside from advanced slap bass, I am comfortable teaching any style. I've played bass in everything from Blues/Jazz to Funk to Metal bands.<br>
<br>
My rate is $40 per hour. I teach almost exclusively hour-long lessons, as opposed to 1/2 hours. 1/2 hours, in my opinion, are only good for youth students. (under 11). It's better to do an hour every-other week than a 1/2 hour weekly. I teach at my studio in Berkeley. I'm close to Bart. I offer student and senior discounts. All ages. All Levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time. Please write back with a little about your playing, and we can take it from there.<br>

I've sung on pitches for commercials from Doritoes, Fanta and Ebay to Dodge and Mustang, working with Dustpan Studios and others music houses in the Bay Area.<br>

Looking to learn blues guitar?<br>
<br>
I've got 35+ years of experience touring and playing with some of the best in the business.<br>
<br>
My credits include Elvin Bishop, Dr. John, Otis Clay, Maria Muldaur, and others.<br>
<br>
I can help you:<br>
<br>
- learn the various forms of blues, from 8-bar to 12-bar to 16-bar and beyond<br>
- with basic theory which allows you the ability to solo over the forms (simple! simple! doesn't have to be complicated and scary)<br>
- some very basic ear training to recognize chord movements<br>
- learn useful practical chord variations<br>
- learn performance skills to be able to play in a live environment<br>
<br>
I can help beginners, intermediate players, and professional/advanced players.<br>
<br>
I can help folks who have learned mostly by ear and are self-taught.<br>
<br>
I also have access to a substantial library of blues/New Orleans R&B and funk for use as learning materials.<br>
<br>
Come to me with your favorite song and we'll play it together!<br>
<br>
I'm located on the SF peninsula and have a studio in San Francisco as well.  I can come to you or you can come to me, as needed.<br>

You love the blues and I can teach you how to play them!<br>
<br>
I have extensive experience, both road and in the studio, with such individuals as Dr. John, Maria Muldaur, Elvin Bishop, Otis Clay and others.<br>
<br>
Bring your favorite song and we'll learn to play it together, whether it's blues, R&B, funk, New Orleans, or any kind of roots music.<br>
<br>
I have access to a studio space in the Potrero Hill area, or your home.<br>
<br>
We will learn:<br>
- simple blues progressions and chord forms<br>
- extremely simple theory that allows you to solo within those structures, including some basic ear training to be able to recognize chords<br>
- basics of learning how to perform live with others<br>
- jam techniques for more advanced players<br>
- anything else you can think of - I'll do my very best to help you!<br>
<br>
I can also help you choose gear, and can help more advanced students and professionals with specific areas of interest.<br>
<br>
Let's make it fun!<br>

I would like to connect and work with somebody or a band to play and create pop-rock/dance/alternative music. I have recorded two songs of my own with a local producer. I am interested in teaming up with someone or a band that can play instruments, co-write lyrics and sing choruses. I really like singing and live performances. I just turned 40 years of age, and have lots of ideas to make music (with lyrics).<br>
<br>
Get back to me with some info about your bio, and what you've done musically speaking. I can send you a link to my YouTube Channel or MySpace Page.<br>
<br>
Looking forward, and let's the music play.<br>

I would like to connect and work with somebody or a band to play and create pop-rock/dance/alternative music. I have recorded two songs of my own with a local producer. I am interested in teaming up with someone or a band that can play instruments, co-write lyrics and sing choruses. I really like singing and live performances. I just turned 40 years of age, and have lots of ideas to make music (with lyrics).<br>
<br>
Get back to me with some info about your bio, and what you've done musically speaking. I can send you a link to my YouTube Channel or MySpace Page.<br>
<br>
Looking forward, and let's the music play.<br>

I have some nice arrangements for wedding march, to and from the altar.<br>

Please check availability as early as possible. Short notice is okay too, if I am available.

Experienced drummer avilable in San Jose area for a R & B, Top-40, Soul, Funk COVER band who can use my services.  I got excellent equipment, transportation, resume that covers hotel circuit and Vegas, and I am honest, dependable, and not a show off.  I do believe in always doing your homework and taking practice very seriously.  I also think that looks are important and a band should dress in appropriate attire.  Prefer a band with lots of talent and experience.  I would be interested in bands currently with bookings or if your close to playing out.  Interested in playing nice rooms like Doubletree or other Hotels.  Thanks!  (Thanks for all the interest and replies, but Im very clear that I do NOT want to play originals or Classic rock/blues...nothing wrong with it, but not my thing!)

A couple of caveats before you call: Although I appreciate the offers, I am not looking to play restaurant or cafe gigs in exchange for a meal and tips. I also am not looking to 'start a band', although I am willing to do a rehearsal for a paid gig. Not 'copping an attitude', just saving us all some time.

Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm new to the area and I'm seeking a band with whom to play classic rock, blues, maybe a touch of jazz etc. <br>
<br>
Still reading?  <br>
<br>
Okay, Hammond B3/Leslie 145 (real thing, but chopped), e-piano (grand piano, Rhodes, etc.) and synth. Influences/repertoire: Doors, Cream, Jimi, Spencer Davis, Clapton, RHCP, Deep Purple, Stevie, Stevie, U2,  Carlos, Stones, ACDC, newer stuff, older stuff, Joe Zavano, Chick, Herbie, Franz, Johannes, the other Johannes, Ludwig. (Alright. I admit I'm getting silly and I'm as vintage as most these myself). I'm not much on country.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping you have a band or potential band with good players, probably with day jobs, really good vocals and a lock-out-type practice space.  I'm ready to learn your stuff, to contribute stuff and to fit in. I guess I think of keys as sometimes part of the rhythm section and sometimes out in front.<br>
<br>
Check out the band I just left at www.redfishsb.com. They are in Santa Barbara and I'm now in Redwood City, which is the only reason I'm not playing with them anymore. Call me at 415/418-4944. <br>
<br>
Max

Rock Guitarist looking for band or players mainly bass, drums, and vocals.<br>
I'm into covers or an all original format or a mix of the two.  I have been playing<br>
semi pro level guitar for many years.  Main influences are Cream, Hendrix, ZZ Top,<br>
Zeppelin, Trower, VH, Montrose, Satriani, Journey...ect.  I do not have a place to play, <br>
and I do not have a PA but I due have pro gear and a killer sound.  I can cover vocals <br>
as well in a power trio format if needed.  Check out my sample link below.  If its the<br>
sound you are looking for lets set up a jam on the Pennisula or South Bay preferred.<br>

I offer coaching of any or all phases of rehearsal for instrumental (all instruments) and vocal chamber groups preparing music for from the baroque to the present (in standard notation).<br>
Assessment includes identifying your core strengths and apparent musical intentions, and addressing matters of presentation, rehearsal, acoustics, etc.<br>
Experienced pianists, string players, and vocalists will likely awaken to musical issues previously beneath the surface and technical resolutions of those issues, though I am sensitive that people may have their own preferred ways of doing things, as well as their unique interpretations. I am not here to judge, but to make observations and recommendations. Coaching for any phase of rehearsal of wind and brass will inspire sophisticated musicality and a new sense of musicianship.<br>
Hope to see you "there" wherever that is for you!<br>

Guitar player plus vocals here.  Big influence is phish, looking to put together something jam oriented.  In my 30s, have time on my hands, and want to concentrate on one good project.  Have rehearsal spot available on weekdays. <br>

Drummers, there's a decent set already there if you want to come by and jam.

Seeking drummer with weekday availability to jam in west oakland (OMC).  Decent drum set is already set up there.  Just bring your sticks!<br>
<br>
I'm a guitar player/singer in my 30s.  Just met a great bassist/singer last week.  <br>
<br>
What we have in common is we both like phish.  Last time we played/sang a bunch of phish covers.  This is a new/forming project.  <br>
<br>
We plan on writing some original music.  But, since we both know a bunch of phish songs, this is like a standard repertoire for us.<br>
<br>
Background in jazz, prog and/or jamband music a plus.  I like drummers who are into dynamics and can get quiet as well as loud.<br>

				Whether you're an accomplished 
				musician, just getting started in the wonderful world of guitar, 
				or are somewhere in between. . . a guitar player is only as good as 
				his guitar. . . and the guitar is only as good as the set-up. It's 
				with that concept in mind that I offer the specialized service 
				of guitar set-up, maintenance, and repair. I want you and your 
				guitar to be the very best it can be. . . and I want you to have 
				the very best experience while playing your guitar. You'll see, 
				feel, and hear the difference. . . I promise! <br>
 </p>
				<p>
				A good overhaul can be the best 
				thing you ever do for your guitar and your playing! Is your 
				action too high? Do you have buzzing up and down the neck? Is 
				the intonation off? Are your frets worn down? Is the neck just 
				not as straight as it used to be on your favorite axe? Pickups 
				and knobs buzzing and scratchy? I can fix all that and much 
				more! I'll make that baby of yours play better than new! 
				</p>
				<p>
				 </p>
				<p>
				I specialize in guitars, 
				basses, mandolins, and more. Even upright basses. . . if it has strings, I know how to set 
				it up and repair it. Whether your instrument is brand new and needs 
				a good "out of the box" set up, you have an old favorite, or 
				perhaps a valuable classic. . . Dr. Mike
				is your 
				solution. I've been setting up, repairing and building
				guitars professionally for 25+ years. . . so I know a thing or two about your 
				guitar! </p>

<p>

				<p>
Working out of my home based shop in Vallejo I can offer competitive pricing and superior workmanship for all your string instrument needs. From a string change and clean up, to turning lumber into a finished instrument I can make your axe sing! All work guaranteed.</p>

SOLID GUITARIST/KEYBOARDIST/BASSIST AVAILABLE FOR STUDIO WORK<br>
<br>
	Do you need a solid guitarist to lay down the missing tracks in your recordings?  Or perhaps you have a solo recording project that requires guitar parts, basic keyboard parts (including piano, organ, strings or even brass), and/or bass parts?  Well, it's certainly more efficient to hire 1 solid musician for all of these than to hire 3.<br>
<br>
	My name is Greg Studley.  I have been playing guitar since a very young age, and have been teaching, recording, and performing full-time since my graduation from Loyola University New Orleans where I received a BM in Jazz Performance.  Over the years, I have developed a solid level of musicianship working with numerous artists, in multiple genres, and touring internationally.  I currently work as a guitar, bass, and piano instructor, and I am the lead guitarist for Quasar (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quasarband.com">http://www.quasarband.com</a>) and a guitarist, keyboardist, and vocalist for House of Floyd (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.houseoffloyd.com">http://www.houseoffloyd.com</a>).<br>
<br>
Here's a quote from one of my most recent sessions:<br>
<br>
Greg Studley came in as a session guitarist for a client at my studio, Robot Envy Studio. Right off the bat I was impressed with how prepared Greg was. He knew exactly what he was going to play and had all of his guitar parts printed out on sheet music. While recording, Greg was very easy to work with and flexible about adding or changing guitar lines. He even suggested some great additions to the drum part, which really helped the song. On top of everything, Greg's guitar rig sounded great, which made my job of getting good guitar tone pretty easy. Overall, Greg Studley is a great guitarist and a very professional studio musician. I have worked with many session musicians and he is definitely among the top few. Highly recommended! <br>
<br>
-Sammy @ Robot Envy Studio<br>
<br>
	Although my focus has been on the guitar for more than half of my life now, I am also comfortable laying down tracks for piano/keyboard and bass.  I am available for studio sessions for numerous genres of music, including rock (any style of rock, that is), pop, blues, funk, soul, R&B, jazz, fusion, and jamband.  <br>
<br>
	I have all professional equipment including a Line 6 POD X3 Live that can produce just about any guitar sound that you need with numerous effects, along with an Alesis 7 keyboard full of sounds and a Yamaha P-85 with a great acoustic grand piano sound.  I can read standard treble-clef notation, TAB, and chord charts for all of these instruments if the music is already charted.  If not, I can transcribe chords and melodies very well if you have basic recordings.  Also, if you haven't created the parts yet but only have chords, I can compose the needed material.<br>
<br>
	Please visit my website, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gregstudley.com">http://www.gregstudley.com</a> and click on "Performance" to read a detailed bio, hear clips of me playing precise guitar solo reenactments (Comfortably Numb, Hotel California), demo styles (Hard Rock, Blues, and Funk-Fusion), and some original material (jazz).<br>

SOLID GUITARIST/KEYBOARDIST/BASSIST AVAILABLE FOR STUDIO WORK<br>
<br>
	Do you need a solid guitarist to lay down the missing tracks in your recordings?  Or perhaps you have a solo recording project that requires guitar parts, basic keyboard parts (including piano, organ, strings or even brass), and/or bass parts?  Well, it's certainly more efficient to hire 1 solid musician for all of these than to hire 3.<br>
<br>
	My name is Greg Studley.  I have been playing guitar since a very young age, and have been teaching, recording, and performing full-time since my graduation from Loyola University New Orleans where I received a BM in Jazz Performance.  Over the years, I have developed a solid level of musicianship working with numerous artists, in multiple genres, and touring internationally.  I currently work as a guitar, bass, and piano instructor, and I am the lead guitarist for Quasar (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quasarband.com">http://www.quasarband.com</a>) and a guitarist, keyboardist, and vocalist for House of Floyd (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.houseoffloyd.com">http://www.houseoffloyd.com</a>).<br>
<br>
Here's a quote from one of my most recent sessions:<br>
<br>
Greg Studley came in as a session guitarist for a client at my studio, Robot Envy Studio. Right off the bat I was impressed with how prepared Greg was. He knew exactly what he was going to play and had all of his guitar parts printed out on sheet music. While recording, Greg was very easy to work with and flexible about adding or changing guitar lines. He even suggested some great additions to the drum part, which really helped the song. On top of everything, Greg's guitar rig sounded great, which made my job of getting good guitar tone pretty easy. Overall, Greg Studley is a great guitarist and a very professional studio musician. I have worked with many session musicians and he is definitely among the top few. Highly recommended! <br>
<br>
-Sammy @ Robot Envy Studio<br>
<br>
	Although my focus has been on the guitar for more than half of my life now, I am also comfortable laying down tracks for piano/keyboard and bass.  I am available for studio sessions for numerous genres of music, including rock (any style of rock, that is), pop, blues, funk, soul, R&B, jazz, fusion, and jamband.  <br>
<br>
	I have all professional equipment including a Line 6 POD X3 Live that can produce just about any guitar sound that you need with numerous effects, along with an Alesis 7 keyboard full of sounds and a Yamaha P-85 with a great acoustic grand piano sound.  I can read standard treble-clef notation, TAB, and chord charts for all of these instruments if the music is already charted.  If not, I can transcribe chords and melodies very well if you have basic recordings.  Also, if you haven't created the parts yet but only have chords, I can compose the needed material.<br>
<br>
	Please visit my website, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gregstudley.com">http://www.gregstudley.com</a> and click on "Performance" to read a detailed bio, hear clips of me playing precise guitar solo reenactments (Comfortably Numb, Hotel California), demo styles (Hard Rock, Blues, and Funk-Fusion), and some original material (jazz).<br>
<br>
	Because music is my career (not a side project or hobby),  I will not waste your time and money in the studio.  If you are unsure if you will be making the right decision and getting your money's worth, please listen to the many demo clips on my website (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gregstudley.com/performance.html">http://www.gregstudley.com/performance.html</a>). <br>

Metal/hardcore band looking for a technically proficient drummer. 2 guitars and a bass, all with gigging experience. We wrote an opening set with our last drummer before he split and we're ready to start playing shows. We have a lockout downtown and meet twice a week. Influences include Daughters, These Arms Are Snakes, and Russian Circles. Check out the facebook for some rough recordings. We work collaboratively and want someone who can handle dynamic rhythms and make practices.<br>

Bon Jovi Tribute Band looking for a lead guitarist/vocalist!<br>
<br>
Need a guitarist/vocalist to fullfil the Ritchie spot.  Must have your own equipment, we rounded sound; vocals and harmonies are a must, and transportation.  Harmonies are a huge part of capturing this a Bon Jovi sound so if you CANNOT actually sing and or do harmonies DO NOT answer this ad.   <br>
<br>
Pleaese bring a profession attitude :)<br>
<br>
We rehearse in Sunnyvale/SJ......<br>

 We are ready to finish up and go back on the road in 2012. The band already has a deal/funding with a music-venture company. The group has a good dynamic between the players...no substance issues or things of that type. All the members are in their 20's, and have a good look.(and you should too) The ideal person would be interested in beng a permanent member in the band, and would want their vocals on the new EP. Individuals are expected to have a positive attitude and be ready to play all around the US, not just in the bay. If you play guitar and sing, that works too..if you have any other instruments you play-please be sure to list them. Sound wise...we are open..so surprise us.. We sound like a cross between, Foo FIghters,GNR,and Anberlin. If you need more info, or tracks sent to you..please be sure to specify which email address you would like to be contacted at. We thank you for your time and look forward to your response. <br>
