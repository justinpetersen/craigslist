Meyer Sound Labs Inc. is a premier global supplier of professional audio products ranging from 100 kilowatt stadium sound reinforcement systems to state of the art ambiance synthesis and distribution systems.  The company prides itself on attaining the highest achievable sonic fidelity to create the most realistic experience for its customers.<br>
<br>
We are seeking a multi-talented technical professional who has a proven track record in manufacturing process control and testing.  The manufacturing of loudspeaker drivers is a complex process, filled with sources of variation in materials and process parameters.  The successful candidate must have expert knowledge in designing and conducting statistically based experiments (DOE) that optimize manufacturing parameters to achieve high yields at test.  Candidate must be experienced to collect and observe naturally occurring variation in the manufacturing process and correlate to the response characteristics at test.  The net outcome of these efforts are yield optimization through statistically derived process control limits, optimized sampling plans, sensitivity studies, understanding of co-dependencies etc.   It is not required that candidate have specific experience in loudspeaker design or manufacturing, but rather, a solid 5+ year background in DOE, process characterization and process capability study.<br>
<br>
It is also desirable that the candidate have experience in analog parameter characterization and testing in both time and frequency domains, and test data post processing (i.e. Matlab).   This position has ownership of speaker and driver test development when a new product transitions into manufacturing.  This is a hybrid test/process engineering role where both product specification compliance and yield optimization is the key to success.<br>
<br>
Job Requirements:<br>
•	MS or BS in Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics or equivalent with a minimum of 5 years experience as a leader in process characterization and process capability improvement.<br>
<br>
•	Demonstrated track record of module or process integration success where sources of intrinsic or defect based issues were identified and resolved through statistical studies and process capability improved.<br>
<br>
•	DOE expert, jmp or equivalent analysis expert.<br>
<br>
•	Labview programming experience desirable, some type of programming experience required.<br>
<br>
•	Experience in audio testing desirable.<br>
<br>
•	Recent Matlab working knowledge for test data post processing.<br>
<br>
•	Must pass a general and criminal background check.<br>

<p><font face="tahoma"><b>Job Label:</b></font>&nbsp;ENOC-SREENG-GEPO</p>
<p>Energy Engineers who can effectively sell the merits and ROI of energy efficiency solutions in commercial and industrial environments will find a singular career opportunity with EnerNOC in Walnut Creek, California. As an Energy Engineer, you'll be the focal point on projects as you identify and then deliver energy efficiency solutions. In this high visibility role, you're comfortable translating industrial processes with plant engineers and talking about the ROI from capital investments in industrial equipment such as new industrial refrigeration, pumping equipment or process heat recovery with a Chief Financial Officer. In each instance, you'll put your strong beliefs in energy savings to use as you recruit current customers and new prospects into our utility client's energy efficiency programs. This is a unique and hybrid role, and will be ideal for the seasoned mechanical or chemical engineer who has the technical depth to translate complex processes into energy savings, and the sales skills to establish new client relationships and reinforce existing ones.</p>
<p>EnerNOC unlocks the full value of energy management for our utility and commercial, institutional, and industrial (C&I) customers by reducing real-time demand for electricity, increasing energy efficiency, improving energy supply transparency in competitive markets, and mitigating emissions. We accomplish this by delivering world-class energy management applications including DemandSMART™, comprehensive demand response; EfficiencySMART™, data-driven energy efficiency; SupplySMART™, energy price and risk management; and CarbonSMART™, enterprise carbon management. Our Energy Network Operations Center (EnerNOC) supports these applications across thousands of C&I customer sites throughout the world. Using our C&I customers' energy usage flexibility, we make capacity, energy, ancillary services, and carbon products available to grid operators and our more than 100 utility customers on demand as a cost-effective alternative to traditional power generation, transmission, and distribution. For more information, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enernoc.com/">www.enernoc.com</a></p>
<p>As our Walnut Creek, California-based Energy Engineer, your first mission will be coming up to speed on our multiple program offerings. This includes mastering our industry-specific lingo and gaining the confidence to converse with utility representatives about program opportunities and prospective end users about participation in such programs. In focusing on end users with high energy consumption, you'll seek out those with a budget for new capital investments and/or those with a corporate sustainability mandate or goal. Your challenge in many cases will simply be getting someone with decision making powers to listen, and your persistence will be vital in getting someone to finally open the door and allow you to schedule a visit. Key markers for success will include your ability to identify/clarify energy savings calculations, to know the appropriate standards/codes, and, most importantly, to make a compelling argument from your calculations during a customer presentation that addresses payback, internal rate of return, net present value and return on investment.  Qualified candidates should be able to stop a cocktail party in its tracks with detailed conversations about the energy efficiency improvements that can come from upgrades to, or modifications of, industrial pumping systems, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, refrigeration, electric motors and compressed air systems. Being a subject matter expert in the above gets you in the door and may lend credibility to your recommendations. However, it's not enough; you must have the business savvy and persuasive skills to get clients to take action. Now is the ideal time to join our organization and to accelerate the trajectory of your career in this incredibly dynamic industry.<br><br>EnerNOC is an Equal Opportunity Employer. <br><div><br></div>

Our Energy Network Operations Center (EnerNOC) supports these applications across thousands of C&I customer sites throughout the world. Using our C&I customers' energy usage flexibility, we make capacity, energy, ancillary services, and carbon products available to grid operators and our more than 100 utility customers on demand as a cost-effective alternative to traditional power generation, transmission, and distribution. For more information, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enernoc.com/">www.enernoc.com</a></p>
<p>As our Walnut Creek, California-based Energy Engineer, your first mission will be coming up to speed on our multiple program offerings. This includes mastering our industry-specific lingo and gaining the confidence to converse with utility representatives about program opportunities and prospective end users about participation in such programs. In focusing on end users with high energy consumption, you'll seek out those with a budget for new capital investments and/or those with a corporate sustainability mandate or goal. Your challenge in many cases will simply be getting someone with decision making powers to listen, and your persistence will be vital in getting someone to finally open the door and allow you to schedule a visit. Key markers for success will include your ability to identify/clarify energy savings calculations, to know the appropriate standards/codes, and, most importantly, to make a compelling argument from your calculations during a customer presentation that addresses payback, internal rate of return, net present value and return on investment.  Qualified candidates should be able to stop a cocktail party in its tracks with detailed conversations about the energy efficiency improvements that can come from upgrades to, or modifications of, industrial pumping systems, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, refrigeration, electric motors and compressed air systems. Being a subject matter expert in the above gets you in the door and may lend credibility to your recommendations. However, it's not enough; you must have the business savvy and persuasive skills to get clients to take action. Now is the ideal time to join our organization and to accelerate the trajectory of your career in this incredibly dynamic industry.<br><br>EnerNOC is an Equal Opportunity Employer. <br><div><br></div>

We are looking for a person with strong technical and leadership skills in the design and development of innovative hardware products, including products with significant electronic and software components and products based on novel physical or biophysical systems.  Experience (at least 5 years) as a principal investigator on commercial and/or government contracts is required.  Experience in moving innovations from the research proof-of-concept stage through prototyping in collaboration with a network of partners is also required.  This person will work on a variety of projects cutting across many technologies and markets, requiring both breadth and the discipline that comes from being deeply strong in a few select technical subjects.   Accordingly, the successful candidate will bring experience in some of the following technical areas:  hardware design & engineering for electronic systems, design for manufacturing, embedded systems engineering, lower power design, analog and mixed analog-digital design & engineering, biotechnology product R&D, and medical devices R&D.  Strength in interpreting market feedback toward the development of a minimal viable product is also desired.<br>
<br>
PARC (Palo Alto Research Center, www.parc.com) is a premier R&D center for innovation.  Our technical staff is organized into four labs: Hardware Systems, Electronic Materials & Devices, Intelligent Systems, and Computing Science.  This position is in the Hardware Systems lab, but the successful candidate will be expected to maintain strong collaborations with researchers from all four labs.    We work with clients to create and co-develop innovations across a broad range of markets and technologies.  Many projects deliver at the proof-of-concept phase, but an increasing number require prototype development in collaboration with external partners and vendors, which will be one important focus of this position.  Internal resources include both excellent lab facilities and strong business development support.  PARC also provides a significant level of internal R&D funds to the research staff, setting us apart from many other R&D firms.<br>
This position requires a strong technical background, including either a Masters with 12+ years of experience or a PhD with 6+ years of experience in an engineering field.  <br>

We are looking for a person with strong technical and leadership skills in the design and development of innovative hardware products, including products with significant electronic and software components and products based on novel physical or biophysical systems.  Experience (at least 5 years) as a principal investigator on commercial and/or government contracts is required.  Experience in moving innovations from the research proof-of-concept stage through prototyping in collaboration with a network of partners is also required.  This person will work on a variety of projects cutting across many technologies and markets, requiring both breadth and the discipline that comes from being deeply strong in a few select technical subjects.   Accordingly, the successful candidate will bring experience in some of the following technical areas:  hardware design & engineering for electronic systems, design for manufacturing, embedded systems engineering, lower power design, analog and mixed analog-digital design & engineering, biotechnology product R&D, and medical devices R&D.  Strength in interpreting market feedback toward the development of a minimal viable product is also desired.<br>
<br>
PARC (Palo Alto Research Center, www.parc.com) is a premier R&D center for innovation.  Our technical staff is organized into four labs: Hardware Systems, Electronic Materials & Devices, Intelligent Systems, and Computing Science.  This position is in the Hardware Systems lab, but the successful candidate will be expected to maintain strong collaborations with researchers from all four labs.    We work with clients to create and co-develop innovations across a broad range of markets and technologies.  Many projects deliver at the proof-of-concept phase, but an increasing number require prototype development in collaboration with external partners and vendors, which will be one important focus of this position.  Internal resources include both excellent lab facilities and strong business development support.  PARC also provides a significant level of internal R&D funds to the research staff, setting us apart from many other R&D firms.<br>
This position requires a strong technical background, including either a Masters with 12+ years of experience or a PhD with 6+ years of experience in an engineering field.  <br>

The net outcome of these efforts are yield optimization through statistically derived process control limits, optimized sampling plans, sensitivity studies, understanding of co-dependencies etc.   It is not required that candidate have specific experience in loudspeaker design or manufacturing, but rather, a solid 5+ year background in DOE, process characterization and process capability study.<br>
<br>
It is also desirable that the candidate have experience in analog parameter characterization and testing in both time and frequency domains, and test data post processing (i.e. Matlab).   This position has ownership of speaker and driver test development when a new product transitions into manufacturing.  This is a hybrid test/process engineering role where both product specification compliance and yield optimization is the key to success.<br>

Founded in 2001, Speck Products is a leader in fun, functional and fashionable cases for the personal electronic devices people increasingly depend on: iPhones, MacBooks, smartphones, iPads, e-readers and the like. We're located in downtown Palo Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, CA--home to innovators from Hewlett and Packard to Page and Brin, Jobs and Woz. All of us at Speck share a common goal: to make the essential and magical gadgets you love even more awesome. Speck's line of products can be found at Apple retail stores, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us and at other electronics dealers worldwide.<br>
<br>
We are looking for an experienced Production Manager to join the Speck Operations team. As our products have shorter life cycles than most products, the key to success in this position is to be able to get high quality products to our customers before our competition does!  Sound interesting?  Read on!<br>
<br>
The Production Manager will report to the VP of Operations and will be primarily responsible for assuring that production dates are met, suppliers are functioning at full efficiency, and that our customers are assured of a continuous supply of Speck's products.  <br>
<br>
As all of Speck's suppliers are off-shore, the candidate must have extensive experience in managing remote manufacturing facilities.  This position is responsible for developing a supplier capacity database for varied and dissimilar processes, products, and supplier capabilities.  You must maintain this database in order to maximize supplier efficiencies and minimize production schedule changes.   The capacity database will be used to determine which supplier receives which product mix, and to forecast their ability to meet aggressive production delivery dates.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, tooling capacity planning and projection will be required to meet forecast demands in the out-months, and well ahead of need.  The ability to maximize supplier capacities and balancing multiple suppliers is a key performance measure.  To achieve these goals, the candidate must be familiar with production planning, tooling fabrication processes and lead-times, manufacturing operations, capacity planning, and line balancing.   <br>
<br>
This position will be Palo Alto, CA based with frequent travel to China and Taiwan anticipated at first.  After relationships are cemented, less frequent travel is anticipated.  Must be free to travel with short notice to resolve problems when they occur.  This position will have a subordinate counterpart in China that will be on-site for day-to-day problem-solving.  <br>
<br>
To be able to manage this function the applicant should have as a minimum:<br>
•	10-15 years experience in a production environment preferably in a highly responsible position<br>
•	BS or equivalent degree in engineering, manufacturing engineering, or production management<br>
•	Consumer products manufacturing experience a plus<br>
•	Molding or Cut & sew experience a definite plus <br>
•	Extensive experience with off-shore suppliers<br>
•	The ability to manage differing cultural considerations<br>
•	A comprehensive understanding of production scheduling and the supply chain<br>
•	A firm understanding of the logistics of off-shore operations<br>
•	Demonstrated history of root cause analysis as it relates to production problem solving<br>
•	Ability to travel off-shore without restriction<br>
•	Bi-lingual skills with English/Mandarin is highly desired but not a fixed requirement<br>
•	Excellent communication skills, with MS Office proficiency required<br>
•	Proactive vs. reactive personality is required<br>
•	High proficiency in data collection, reduction, and analysis<br>
•	High proficiency in managing multiple competing priorities <br>
•	A deeply developed desire to win<br>
•	An ability to manage the micro-details without losing sight of the macro situation<br>
<br>
Please send us your resume and cover letter with salary requirements.
