Two young progressive and very pragmatic political non-profit organizations are seeking a joint executive assistant/office manager for a very small office. One of the organizations deals with informing people about Congressional voting records, the other, running issue messaging campaigns spotlighting the voting records of conservative members of Congress. (For more information about the organizations go to www.ProgressivePunch.org and www.ProgressiveKick.org). Our ideal candidate for this position would have a progressive perspective, a commitment to social change efforts and a personal interest in the worlds of government and politics. The ideal candidate also absolutely has to have the qualifications and the personality to effectively handle the job requirements detailed below.<br>
<br>
The job requires constant close interface with Joshua Grossman, who is both organizations' president, (checking and drafting emails, making phone calls, keeping his schedule) as well as some independent projects (and everything in between). It's a friendly but fairly hectic environment -- this position is in addition to a part-time Executive Assistant.<br>
<br>
We need someone who is a very fast and accurate typist (at least 75 wpm) with good spelling skills (for dictation), who is able to multitask and deal with lots of interruptions without dropping threads and who possesses an analytical bent. The ability to follow very precise directions in a very precise manner is key. You should be a hyper-meticulous person -- the kind who organizes your CDs/DVDs by alphabet, checks the bank's figures on your bank statement, etc. The best suited applicant will have a cheerful, upbeat disposition and be able to remain unflustered, maintain almost impeccable accuracy and attention to detail while also keeping track of multiple tasks and deadlines in the midst of interruptions and perpetually shifting priorities. Office work experience is required. Good basic math skills (algebra, arithmetic) are a plus.<br>
<br>
Joshua is not emotionally volatile and is often playful and funny but at the same time he is a very intellectually demanding East Coastishly energetic go-getter-- so you've got to be able to keep up --especially by being very meticulous. This isn't an emotionally intense place to work, but it is intellectually intense. We do lots of ultra-systematic and effective prioritizing, nevertheless you have to be able to not be psychologically overwhelmed by a multitude of different tasks clamoring for your attention.<br>
<br>
We require an assistant who is willing to commit to work for us at least 1.5 years, preferably longer. <br>
<br>
Salary depends on experience and skills. Please put salary requirements in your application. Applicants who don't specify a minimum salary level in their cover letter will not be considered for the position.<br>
<br>
We are located in an extremely accessible area -- one block from Downtown Oakland's 19th Street BART Station.<br>
<br>
Please send BOTH COVER LETTER AND RESUME to: jobs "at" voterpunch.org or respond to this Craigslist posting.<br>
<br>
Specific Tasks:<br>
<br>
* Answer phones, set up phone appts/conferences, maintain Joshuaâs calendar.<br>
<br>
* Monitor multiple email accounts and prepare correspondence.<br>
<br>
* Call/follow-up with vendors, clients, designers, fundraisers, etc. as needed.<br>
<br>
* Track status on all correspondences and projects.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
* Work with vote description writers and other contractors, overseeing their work.<br>
<br>
* Pay bills and maintain accounts on Quickbooks (simple bookkeeping -- could be learned on job) as needed.<br>
<br>
* Prepare, review and submit IRS filings, legal documents and grant proposals, as needed.<br>
<br>
* Research information using internet and other resources.<br>
<br>

International Council on Clean Transportation<br>
San Francisco, CA or Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
The ICCT is a small and dynamic environmental organization with a unique approach to addressing climate change and air quality impact from the transportation sector.  We work closely with governments in the top vehicle markets around the world (US, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, and South Korea) and serve as an international best practices center for policies addressing air quality and climate change impacts from vehicles and fuels. The ICCT has offices in the United States (Washington, D.C. and San Francisco) as well as in Brussels and Beijing. For more information, visit www.theicct.org<br>
<br>
For the last several years, environmental and energy agencies in major vehicle markets (Japan, US, China, Mexico, Canada, Europe) have been developing and refining first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards for the large and extremely diverse heavy-duty vehicle sector.  The vehicles in this sector range from long-haul tractor-trailer combinations to urban buses to 1-ton pickup trucks. This is a growing practice area for the ICCT, and we are building a world-class team of technical and policy experts to assist governments with the development of these regulations.  It is within this context that the ICCT is looking to hire an experienced heavy-duty vehicle technology and policy expert with significant project and staff management experience.  Expertise should cover diesel engine efficiency and emission control technologies as well as air quality and climate policies aimed at the transportation sector. The position will remain open until filled.<br>
<br>
This position will work to identify, refine, and promote policies and methods to improve air quality and reduce the climate impact of heavy-duty vehicles (HDV). The work outputs of this position will be immediately applicable to ongoing policymaking in domestic and international forums. This position will report to the Program Director overseeing the HDV, marine, and aviation programs. The position will require frequent domestic and international travel, primarily for outreach to policymakers and to attend policy and technical workshops.<br>
<br>
Heavy-duty Vehicle Program lead tasks will generally include: <br>
&#61607;	Designing and leading research projects on emerging issues at the intersection of technology and environmental policy making (e.g. efficiency technology potential for HDVs in 2020-2025)<br>
&#61607;	Managing a team of four to five research staff, four to six consultants, and coordinating research priorities with six country/regional leads <br>
&#61607;	Performing quantitative and qualitative analysis of current and proposed policy and strategies and provide technical support for policy implementation to local partners<br>
&#61607;	Writing progress reports, policy briefs, and ICCT technical reports for both internal and external audiences<br>
&#61607;	Developing and implementing an outreach strategy to advance ICCT's policy recommendations within the key international and national policy forums. Outreach activities range from making high-level policy-maker briefings to organizing workshops to talking to the media.<br>
&#61607;	Participating in projects in ICCT's other program areas based on specific interest, qualification and need.<br>
<br>
The position's workplan for 2012 will include helping develop and carrying out a suite of research projects focused on the second phase GHG standards in the United States and GHG policy development in Europe.  Other projects include HDV efficiency and conventional pollutant regulation development in China, Mexico, India, and Brazil. <br>
<br>
Qualifications: The ideal candidate will have a strong technical background with a foundation in heavy-duty engine and vehicle technology, engine/vehicle emission and efficiency testing, knowledge of air quality, climate change and transportation policies and a minimum of five years of related work experience. A master's degree in engineering, environmental science, or related discipline is preferred. The position requires excellent quantitative, analytic, and research skills, along with strong written and verbal communications skills.  Proven leadership and supervisory experience with a small staff and strong project management skills are also essential. The ideal candidate will be highly organized, self-directed, and creative and strategic in problem-solving and identifying policy needs. Fluency in a language other than English is also desirable as is international work experience or significant travels.<br>
 <br>
Job details: Salary will be competitive and commensurate with experience and a generous benefits package is provided.<br>
<br>
Application details: Please send a resume, cover letter summarizing your interests and qualifications, a writing sample, name and contact information of three references (letters not necessary), and salary expectations to jobs@theicct.org.

WHO WE ARE<br>
<br>
Since 1984, Larkin Street Youth Services has been committed to helping San Francisco's most vulnerable youth ages 12-24 move beyond street life. This commitment has fueled the development of a comprehensive continuum of services that is nationally recognized as a model of innovative and effective care. We offer stability, safety, and the opportunity for a better life.<br>
<br>
Larkin Street's continuum provides a range of housing options--from immediate emergency shelter to permanent supportive housing--in addition to essential wraparound services that offer kids the resources and skills they need to exit street life. Supportive services include education, technology and employment training; healthcare, including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV services; and case management.<br>
<br>
Our success rate in helping kids get off the street for good testifies to a simple truth: given safety, shelter, compassion, guidance, and enough positive options, kids can find their own solutions.

WHO WE ARE<br>
<br>

<p>Since 1984, Larkin Street Youth Services (LSYS) has been committed to helping San Francisco's most vulnerable youth ages 12-24 move beyond street life. This commitment has fueled the development of a comprehensive continuum of services that is nationally recognized as a model of innovative and effective care. We offer stability, safety, and the opportunity for a better life.</p>
<p>Larkin Street's continuum provides a range of housing options from immediate emergency shelter to permanent supportive housingâ"in addition to essential wraparound services that offer kids the resources and skills they need to exit street life. Supportive services include education, technology and employment training; healthcare, including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV services; and case management.</p>
<p>Our success rate in helping kids get off the street for good testifies to a simple truth: given safety, shelter, compassion, guidance, and enough positive options, kids can find their own solutions. We believe all youth deserve the chance to reach their full potential and contribute their best to the world.</p>
<b>PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES</b>
<p>The primary responsibilities for Counselor are to provide guidance, information and services, within the agency's mission and goals, to homeless and runaway youth and young adults in a shelter and/or transitional or supportive housing program(s). They are to maintain a safe and supportive multi-cultural environment and motivate youth to explore and accept alternatives to street life.</p>
<p><b>QUALIFICIATIONS</b></p>
BA Degree preferred or three years of social service experience required. One year previous experience working with homeless and runaway youth in the arena of substance use, newly housed or mental health required. Ability to work with and relate to diverse high-risk youth living on the streets. Ability to work in a multi-cultural environment. Weekends and overnight shifts may be required.  Bilingual in English/Spanish.
<p><b>HOW TO APPLY</b></p>
Submit a cover letter and resume to brc-di@larkinstreetyouth.org. Include the job title "Bilingual Residential Counselor- Drop In/Diamond Youth Shelter" in the subject line of your email.

LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE -- LAW FELLOW INTERNSHIPS <br>
<br>
California Lawyers for the Arts seeks newly licensed attorneys to serve as Law Fellows and to assist with the administration of our Lawyer Referral Service. C.L.A.'s LRS is the only statewide lawyer referral service licensed by the State Bar of California and has been operating for 35 years. C.L.A.'s LRS annually refers over 1,200 California creative artists and arts organizations to our panel attorneys. <br>
<br>
Position is available NOW. Should funding permit, this position may grow into a paid permanent position. <br>
<br>
Time Commitment: Full-time preferred, but if part-time then 20+ hours over at least 3 days per week. <br>
<br>
Program Description: LRS is a service that refers clients to members of our attorney panel for consultation on a wide variety of arts-related matters such as copyright and trademark protection, contract review and negotiation, business partnerships and nonprofit incorporation, etc. <br>
<br>
Duties: Law Fellows will take a leadership role, and with other paralegal and law student interns, and will interview clients (primarily over the phone) and will perform case intakes. Interns will prepare concise fact-statements for attorneys presenting the legal issues and relevant facts of each case. Interns will then locate and select appropriate attorneys for each case. <br>
<br>
Supervision: Law Fellows will be supervised directly by Bob Pimm, Chief Learning Officer and Director of Legal Services. As Law Fellows become more comfortable with the C.L.A.'s LRS service, they will be able to "run the desk" on their own. <br>
<br>
Benefits to Interns: Law Fellows will spend most of their time on the phone with clients and attorneys. Law Fellows will refine their ability to issue spot, interview clients and communicate legal issues clearly and succinctly to attorneys serving on CLA's Lawyer Referral Service Panel. Participation in the LRS program teaches the practical day-to-day legal issues facing a wide range of creative artists, the "jargon" of the arts and entertainment law practice, and also about the professionals performing services for artists throughout the Bay Area. Interns will gain practical knowledge about how legal disputes and issues are handled in a "real world" setting. The internship is also an invaluable networking opportunity in a profession that is extremely relationship-driven. Many of our Law Fellows are subsequently hired by law firms following their internships partly based on the practical experience gained during their internship with CLA.<br>
<br>
California Lawyers for the Arts is a relaxed, fun place to work and it gives interns a chance to use their talents to help an under-served, under-funded and often legally unsophisticated population. Recent years in the Bay Area have been tough on the creative arts and entertainment communities. More than ever, artists and arts organizations need the help of bright, motivated advocates. <br>
We receive a very large number of applications and preference is given to interns who have volunteered for our organization before their internship. <br>

LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE -- LAW FELLOW INTERNSHIPS <br>
<br>
California Lawyers for the Arts seeks newly licensed attorneys to serve as Law Fellows and to assist with the administration of our Lawyer Referral Service. C.L.A.'s LRS is the only statewide lawyer referral service licensed by the State Bar of California and has been operating for 35 years. C.L.A.'s LRS annually refers over 1,200 California creative artists and arts organizations to our panel attorneys. <br>
<br>
Position is available NOW. Should funding permit, this position may grow into a paid permanent position. <br>
<br>
Time Commitment: Full-time preferred, but if part-time then 20+ hours over at least 3 days per week. <br>
<br>
Program Description: LRS is a service that refers clients to members of our attorney panel for consultation on a wide variety of arts-related matters such as copyright and trademark protection, contract review and negotiation, business partnerships and nonprofit incorporation, etc. <br>
<br>
Duties: Law Fellows will take a leadership role, and with other paralegal and law student interns, and will interview clients (primarily over the phone) and will perform case intakes. Interns will prepare concise fact-statements for attorneys presenting the legal issues and relevant facts of each case. Interns will then locate and select appropriate attorneys for each case. <br>
<br>
Supervision: Law Fellows will be supervised directly by Bob Pimm, Chief Learning Officer and Director of Legal Services. As Law Fellows become more comfortable with the C.L.A.'s LRS service, they will be able to "run the desk" on their own. <br>
<br>
Benefits to Interns: Law Fellows will spend most of their time on the phone with clients and attorneys. Law Fellows will refine their ability to issue spot, interview clients and communicate legal issues clearly and succinctly to attorneys serving on CLA's Lawyer Referral Service Panel. Participation in the LRS program teaches the practical day-to-day legal issues facing a wide range of creative artists, the "jargon" of the arts and entertainment law practice, and also about the professionals performing services for artists throughout the Bay Area. Interns will gain practical knowledge about how legal disputes and issues are handled in a "real world" setting. The internship is also an invaluable networking opportunity in a profession that is extremely relationship-driven. Many of our Law Fellows are subsequently hired by law firms following their internships partly based on the practical experience gained during their internship with CLA.<br>
<br>
California Lawyers for the Arts is a relaxed, fun place to work and it gives interns a chance to use their talents to help an under-served, under-funded and often legally unsophisticated population. Recent years in the Bay Area have been tough on the creative arts and entertainment communities. More than ever, artists and arts organizations need the help of bright, motivated advocates. <br>
We receive a very large number of applications and preference is given to interns who have volunteered for our organization before their internship. <br>
<br>
To apply please use the LRS Application Form (.pdf file) located at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.calawyersforthearts.org/Default.aspx?pageId=597337">http://www.calawyersforthearts.org/Default.aspx?pageId=597337</a>.

This position is based in a facility licensed by the Community Care Licensing (CCL) Division of the Department of Social Services in the state of CA. All employees of this facility must clear a Livescan background check. Any person with previous convictions at any point in their lives will not receive a clearance from CCL. This includes all convictions, felonies, misdemeanors and DUIs.<br>
<br>
Previous convictions are not an automatic bar to employment at other non licensed Larkin Street Youth Services sites. Each case will be considered on its own merit.<br>
<br>
WHO WE ARE<br>
Since 1984, Larkin Street Youth Services (LSYS) has been committed to helping San Francisco's most vulnerable youth ages 12-24 move beyond street life. This commitment has fueled the development of a comprehensive continuum of services that is nationally recognized as a model of innovative and effective care. We offer stability, safety, and the opportunity for a better life.<br>
<br>
Larkin Street's continuum provides a range of housing options--from immediate emergency shelter to permanent supportive housing--in addition to essential wraparound services that offer kids the resources and skills they need to exit street life. Supportive services include education, technology and employment training; healthcare, including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV services; and case management.<br>
<br>
Our success rate in helping kids get off the street for good testifies to a simple truth: given safety, shelter, compassion, guidance, and enough positive options, kids can find their own solutions.

This position is based in a facility licensed by the Community Care Licensing (CCL) Division of the Department of Social Services in the state of CA. All employees of this facility must clear a Livescan background check. Any person with previous convictions at any point in their lives will not receive a clearance from CCL. This includes all convictions, felonies, misdemeanors and DUIs.<br>
<br>
Previous convictions are not an automatic bar to employment at other non licensed Larkin Street Youth Services sites. Each case will be considered on its own merit.<br>

WHO WE ARE<br>
Since 1984, Larkin Street Youth Services (LSYS) has been committed to helping San Francisco's most vulnerable youth ages 12-24 move beyond street life. This commitment has fueled the development of a comprehensive continuum of services that is nationally recognized as a model of innovative and effective care. We offer stability, safety, and the opportunity for a better life.<br>
<br>
Larkin Street's continuum provides a range of housing options--from immediate emergency shelter to permanent supportive housing--in addition to essential wraparound services that offer kids the resources and skills they need to exit street life. Supportive services include education, technology and employment training; healthcare, including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV services; and case management.<br>
<br>
Our success rate in helping kids get off the street for good testifies to a simple truth: given safety, shelter, compassion, guidance, and enough positive options, kids can find their own solutions. We believe all youth deserve the chance to reach their full potential and contribute their best to the world.<br>

 INTENSIVE TREATMENT FOSTER PARENTS NEEDED IN  ANTIOCH,  MARTINEZ and PITTSBURG areas<br>
<br>
<br>
				MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A  CHILD or TEEN'S LIFE!<br>
<br>
St. Vincent's Foster Family Agency is seeking caring long-term families for our Intensive Treatment Foster Care (ITFC) program and our Residential Based Services (RBS) programs.<br>
<br>
<br>
preferably in the  Concord, Martinez or Pittsburg areas  or surrounding areas in Contra Costa County.  We are seeking homes for teens who are ready to graduate from our residential treatment center and other bay area residential treatment centers, most of whom only need two or three more years before they graduate from high school. Specifically, we have several teens (we are seeking a separate home for each) who have family ties in San Francisco who need ongoing  structure and support in a family setting while they continue to work on some of their treatment goals and continue visiting their families in San Francisco ( or  in the Bay Area). Ideally, we will be able to support them in returning to live with family members, but often this is not possible and they need a family to continue to their progress on their life goals. These guys have many strengths (such as being on an athletic team or active in theater) and have made many gains in their treatment at St. Vincent's School for Boys in San Rafael.   They also have had very challenging early childhoods and require patience and understanding. They will be supported by a team of professionals who help you continue to support his treatment who will be helping him transition and who will meet regularly with your family in your home to help him successfully transition into your family and the community. Your family would also be expected to be a part of his treatment over at the cottage at St. Vincent's in San Rafael while the teen is in the process of honing his skills in order to return to live in a community setting.<br>
<br>
Candidates for this level of foster parenting ideally have experience working with children who have been abused and neglected or have emotional challenges and in a few cases, mental health challenges. However, we will train and closely support any caring family (who can pass criminal record clearances and the requirements listed below) with experience with children who are willing to be team players. Our ITFC and RBS programs serve graduates from St. Vincent's School for Boys and other level 12 treatment centers who are ready to re-enter the community.  Since many of them have been moved and moved and moved, your foster home would be the place from which they graduate high school. Many of our kid clients have birth families, an auntie or a mom, or a step-mom who love them, and whom they regularly visit, but can't provide for them full-time. These guys/gals are looking for families to finish growing up in and to come home to for the holidays once they graduate and emancipate. Many of them have family, friends, mentors, coaches and teachers in the San Francisco and Marin community with whom they wish to remain in contact.<br>
<br>
We are also seeking homes for both boys and girls who are at-risk for entering residential treatment centers after having been in multiple foster homes and for parents willing to participate in training and being part of a team that works intensively with kids in  learning how to follow directions better without trantrumming and learning how to be redirectable when angry. <br>
<br>
St. Vincent's Foster Family Agency provides intensive support services (including comprehensive training, weekly visits with a St. Vincent's social worker in your home or at the child's school , weekly individual therapy, respite services, a tutor and a mentor) and an nontaxable reimbursement to cover clothing, food and other child-rearing expenses. We have many parents who have been with our agency a long time (20 years, 13 years, 6 years and a few years) all of whom would be happy to talk candidly with prospective parents about how it is to work with our agency.  <br>
<br>
Though foster parenting can be challenging at times, it is ultimately a very rewarding experience. Please consider making the difference in the life of a young St. Vincent's graduate. Please do not hesitate to contact Program Director, Megan Chesnut at 415-507-4387 or on my cell 707-799-9270 for more information. If you do not get me within a day, call my assistant, Claudia at 415-507-4289. Or, if you prefer, you can email me your address to mchesnut@cccyo.org and we can send some written information, such as "the Most Frequently Asked Questions."  I strongly urge you to check out our website at www.cccyo.org/stvincents/ click on the Foster Care Program heading at the top.<br>
<br>
The basic requirements are:   <br>
<br>
A clear criminal record:  state law requires all foster parents to be fingerprinted and screened through the state's Child Abuse Index.  You may not have any felony convictions or history of child abuse.  This applies to all persons over 18 living in the home.  Sometimes an appeal to the state can be made regarding a felony which is many years old and does not involve violence, weapons, or harm to children.   <br>
<br>
Good health:  All family members should be in good physical and emotional health and complete a TB test.  <br>
<br>
Financial stability:  Your household must have a stable source of income, such as salary, pension, etc. <br>
<br>
Safety precautions:   Your home must meet state standards, including  such things as smoke detectors and pools or spas having approved covers or fences.  <br>
<br>
Mainly the responsibilities for being a foster parent are the same as for your own children, including quality time with adults.  St. Vincent's foster parents are part of a Treatment Team, working closely with others involved in the child's case.   Your foster child will have one of our social workers assigned to them and he/she will be available to you with 24/7 support.  <br>
<br>
The agency will set up the necessary services the child may need, such as finding a psychologist or appropriate school in your area.  There is a social worker who organizes the team, a clinical coordinator, family specialist, and a family support counselor all available to help ensure the success of the teen in his transition. You will be expected to work closely with this team and to support the youth's relationship with his relatives who are also members on the team.  Because of our agency's philosophy of treating our ITFC  and RBS families as professional team members, most families feel very supported and enjoy the teamwork of helping a child heal together and ultimately witnessing a generational difference. <br>
<br>
<br>
SVFFA makes every effort to match a child and a family with compatible interests which is why so many of our placements work out.    We practice full disclosure, telling foster parents everything we know about the child.  Foster parents can then make an informed decision about the suitability of a child for their family and their decision will be respected.      <br>
<br>
Ongoing child-related trainings are required.  SVFFA holds regular seminars and has a wide variety of books, videos, and tapes which we lend.     <br>
<br>
The Agency pays a monthly stipend which is a reimbursement for expenses and NOT considered income by the IRS.  For our Intensive Treatment Foster Care Program, foster parents with more specialized training (and an extra 60 hours of training we provide) may qualify for "Intensive Treatment Foster Care" and receive a stipend of $1,200- a month.    <br>
<br>
For further information or an application,  please contact Megan at 415/507-4387 or email at mchesnut@cccyo.org<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for considering joining our team and making the difference in the life of a child who is healing from loss. <br>
<br>
St. Vincent's Foster Family Agency is an equal opportunity employer.  <br>
<br>
This is a non-profit organization.   <br>
