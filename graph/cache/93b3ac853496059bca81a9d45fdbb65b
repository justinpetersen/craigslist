This stuff MUST GO. I have absolutely no room for it here, and I could seriously use the cash!<br>
All prices are NEGOTIABLE, but don't try to be unfair with the prices! (If something is listed as 15$, don't try to ask for it for 1$ or something; I paid GOOD money for this stuff and I won't even be making half back) If you want to see something I will gladly take a picture and show you. Feel free to send me a message with any questions. Payment is cash only. PICKUP ONLY!! You MUST arrange to come get it! I have no method of transportation other than BART.<br>

I have over 100 books that are mostly fiction and mostly soft cover that I need to sell immediately.<br>
<br>
There are several different genres available by a variety of authors.  However, if you're looking for sparkly vampire books, there are none of those.<br>
<br>
They are in excellent condition.  You can't even tell that they've ever been read before.  They'd make great gifts for an incredibly low, low price!<br>
<br>
It is killing me to part with my books, as I really love them, but I need the money now.  I'm willing to let them all go for $120.  I'd prefer that someone just buy the whole lot of them.  I would probably be willing to sell half of them if that's all that you wanted.  I don't really want to just sell them one at a time.  And since I need the money right now, I don't think that would be of much help, anyway.<br>
<br>
If you're in the San Jose or Santa Cruz area and wanted to buy them all, I would be willing to drive them over to you and carry them into your palatial estate.<br>
<br>
Have I mentioned how good you're looking today?  You are.  Is that a new shirt?  It looks great on you.<br>
<br>
PLEASE email me if you're interested in buying these.  Thanks.

It was the Student Revolution in Peking that changed history in China.<br>

this is an excellent copy of the Chinese Book decribing the June 4th Student Revolution in 1989. This is a historic turn in the "democracy" of China. <br>

It's a rare book - ideal for anyone who knows how to read chinese and want to see the details of the revolution.<br>

Product Description<br>
Has capitalism failed?<br>
<br>
Is it fundamentally greedy and immoral, enabling the rich to get richer? Are free markets Darwinian places where the most ruthless crush smaller competitors, where vital products and services are priced beyond the ability of many people to afford them?<br>
<br>
Capitalism is the world's greatest economic success story. It is the most effective way to provide for the needs of people and foster the democratic and moral values of a free society. Yet the worst recession in decades has widely--and understandably--shaken people's faith in our system. Even before the current crisis, capitalism received a "bad rap" from a culture ambivalent about free markets and wealth creation.  This crisis of confidence is preventing a full recognition of how we got into the mess we're in today--and why capitalism continues to be the best route to prosperity. <br>
<br>
How Capitalism Will Save Us transcends labels such as "conservative" and "liberal" by showing how the economy really works. When free people in free markets have energy to solve problems and meet the needs and wants of others, they turn scarcity into abundance and develop the innovations that are the foremost drivers of economic growth. The freedom of democratic capitalism is, for example, what enabled Henry Ford to take a plaything of the rich--the car--and transform it into something affordable to working people.<br>
<br>
In the capitalist system, economic growth doesn't mean more of the same--grinding out a few more widgets every year. It's about change to increase overall wealth and give more people the chance for a better life. <br>

Chasing Goldman Sachs: How the Masters of the Universe Melted Wall Street Down . . . And Why They'll Take Us to the Brink Again [Hardcover]<br>

<br>
Editorial Reviews:<br>
Business journalist McGee paints Wall Street as a utility with capital flowing through the system like an electric power grid, noting why it almost failed. She describes the pressure on the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008 to bail out Wall Street firms, why Wall Street was called an "abstraction," and how Wall Street morphed from an intermediary (raising capital) into a casino. Goldman Sachs was the master of its universe, generating average return on equity of 25.4 percent in the decade before the financial crisis, compared with 15 percent annually for four other firms during the same period. Other firms' CEOs chased Goldman Sachs, considering it their model for boosting their own personal wealth and keeping shareholders happy. The author reports, "When left to their own devices, financial services firms . . . will focus almost monomaniacally on what is in their own best interest, seeking out ways to take earn sichigher returns and recruit top talent by paying the most lavish bonuses and offering the most enticing perks. . . . They cannot help themselves." Excellent book. --Mary Whaley <br>
Review<br>
"...masterful...exceptionally lucid, well-written"--Washington Post<br>
<br>

 <br>
"A disturbing account of how Goldman Sachs Group Inc. became a seductively successful Pied Piper, luring rival banks down a path to destruction."-- Bloomberg <br>
 <br>
"McGee's book is full of entertaining and enlightening material." -- Financial Times  <br>

Hamster books.  Three books on how to take care of hamsters and gerbils.  These are great for a young person who wants to learn about these wonderful little animals. My son loved reading and learning how to care for his pet.  Asking $5.00 for all three or $2.00 for each book.<br>
<br>
One magazine type called Hamsters --part of the Popular Pet Series.  Same editors as CRITTERS USA magazine.  Excellent magazine.  A one stop guide to: Diet, Health, Showing, Housing, Behavior, Interaction.<br>
Hamsters for those who care-softcover.<br>
<br>

All books in excellent condition, NO markings or ripped pages.<br>

STAR-SPANGLED MANNERS: IN WHICH MISS MANNERS DEFENDS AMERICAN ETIQUETTE (FOR A CHANGE) by JUDITH MARTIN [$1.00] <br>
<br>
- Used, Excellent Condition (Like New) - Paperback <br>
- 319 Pages <br>
<br>
Back Cover: <br>
"A Fascinating genealogy and spirited defense of our rough-and-ready American manners." - Boston Globe<br>
American Manners- a contradiction in terms? Not so, say the doyenne of etiquette, Miss Manners, in this rendering of the revolutionary drama of our home-grown customs.<br>
Hailed by George Will as "The National Bureau of Standards," Judith Martin recounts here with characteristic wit how Americans fashioned misunderstood origins of our table manners to the much-overlooked legacy of African slaves to etiquette. Ultimately, Star Spangled Manners pay playful homage to the American character, the revolutionary roots and creative independence of our newly minted manners. <br>
"[Martin's] insights remain peerless. From cradle to grave, [she] analyzes every aspect of American life and the rituals that both define and undermine our culture to show us that, although we still may not know what to do, we can at least know why we do it." - Booklist <br>

"A simple set of dos and don'ts, THE RULES will lead you to where you want to be: in a healthy, committed relationship. Unlike today's haphazard dating customs, THE RULES recognizes certain facts of life. That men know what they want. That a man is either attracted to you- or not! That men want a challenge, not an instant or easy victory.<br>
When you follow these commonsense guidelines, you treat yourself with respect and dignity-and demand that men do likewise. Although they sound old-fashioned ("Don't see him more that once or twice a week"), they encourage you to lead a full, satisfying, busy life-outside of romance. Although they seem tough ("Don't talk to a man first'), they will teach you how to accept occasional defeat and move on. And although they require discipline ("No more than casual kissing on the first date"), they will bring out the best in you and in the men you date. The goal? Marriage, in the shortest time possible, to a man you love, who loves you even more than you love him.

Back Cover: <br>
"A chance encounter draws him into Booth's web of intrigue in the last months of the Civil War- and before long he's enmeshed in the most terrifying plot of the century. "Beautifully written and cleverly conceived, David Robertson's Booth joins E.L Doctorow's Ragtime and Gore Vidal's Lincoln as a perfectly rendered historical novel. . . A haunting, riveting contribution to our national literature which the reader will find impossible to put down." -- Douglas Brinkley, Professor of History and Director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies, University of New Orleans"<br>

<br>
-	Used, great condition<br>
-	Paperback<br>
-	113 pages<br>
-	Original 1976 Publication<br>
<br>
Back Cover:<br>
"What is a self-working card trick? A trick that does not depend upon legerdemain or special abilities on the part of the magician but a trick that works automatically because of the mathetmatics inherent in the card deck itself. Long practice and supernormal dexterity are not needed to perform theses tricks, yet they are often among the most entertaining and most spectacular of all card tricks.<br>
The present volume, to our knowledge, is the first commercially available collection of these sure-fire tricks, prepared by one of the best-known modern writers and editors in the field of magic, Karl Fulves, editor of Pallbearer.<br>
Some of these tricks are simple, a good place to begin. Others were specially adapted from professional routines and are here presented for the first time for amateurs. Almost all of these tricks can be worked informally, with a borrowed deck of cards. Some also adapt to stage presentation.<br>
Individual tricks in this book have sold for more than the price of the entire book. Amateurs can use them to get a start in magic and to feel, at once, the rewards of giving a professional performance. Advanced and professional magicians will find tricks to add their acts of informal routines"<br>
