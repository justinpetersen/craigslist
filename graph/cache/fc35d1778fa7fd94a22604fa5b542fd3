Do REAL women come on Craigslist anymore, or are you all spammers these days?<br>
<br>
I AM a real person, and I have the tax returns to prove it. Yes, the first two pics ARE me and they are recent. You can see them unedited if you decide to respond in kind with a pic or two and more than one line about yourself. Gold diggers need not respond. I'm 6-0 and 260, so if you don't see attraction in thick guys don't waste my time. If you're 5-9 and wear 3 or 4 inch heels when we meet, don't complain that I'm not tall enough for you. DUH, you're wearing heels. That would make us pretty similar in stature. I wouldn't mention any of this if I haven't actually experienced it previously, LOL.<br>
<br>
I'm looking for more than just a platonic friend, so please don't waste my time if you're not at least open to something similar, or if you're not emotionally and physically READY for a possible relationship if it should blossom. I'd love an LTR with the right woman. Ideally we'd be fun activity partners (as in movies, dinner, outdoor walks, sporting events, etc.), and we'd also double as personal CPR partners. Don't worry, it doesn't mean that I anticipate having a coronary. On the contrary, being given CPR is my favorite extracurricular activity. I do mean that literally. Ask me if you'd like to know more. ;-) I know, it sounds unusual, but it's actually an important factor in measuring personal chemistry to me. So if this sounds a little TOO outside your realm, we probably won't make a good match.<br>
<br>
Moving on. The personal basics on me:<br>
<br>
WM, as I said 6-0 and 260 lbs. which means thick not obese, I'm DRUG and DISEASE FREE, dark hair, blue eyes, a few tattoos on my upper arms, easy going, living in Fremont, clean with good hygiene, a full time college student in night and online classes, and a small business owner. I don't do drama. I am the father of an infant whom I love unconditionally and of whom I am the primary parent, which is enough of a reason for certain superficial women to write me off. Which is fine because if it's one thing I *don't* need, it's a superficial woman. Sorry ladies, I actually have a past. Don't worry, my baby has a mother and I'm NOT looking for someone else to be one. Just know that my child is my priority, and things would have to be pretty serious before I let ANY other woman be even a small part of her life. I love music (most everything but not too into country), movies (especially comedy and horror), sports (football, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc.), Bay Area sports teams, nice weather, road trips, finding good restaurants, summer BBQ's, and just relaxing. And I absolutely LOVE Halloween.<br>
<br>
I have a few requirements for you which aren't negotiable. You MUST be drug and disease free as I am (I don't do 420, I am 420 *tolerant* to a small extent if you're into it, but never around my baby and NO other exceptions), you MUST be a FEMALE (all your life, LOL), you MUST NOT be a head case, and you MUST NOT be jealous in regard to my parental situation. It would be nice if we had a few things in common. Your ethnicity and body type aren't terribly important, as I've previously been able to establish connections with people of all colors, ages, and sizes. I'm beyond the "party and bullshit" stage, so if you live just to get to the weekend to party, we probably won't make a good match.<br>
<br>
Please put "CPR Partner" in your subject line so I know you're real and you actually read this far. Also, please include a recent good quality pic or two, and in turn I will send you my pics unedited.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing from you. :-)

Bigger guy here looking for a bbw friend with benefits.<br>
<br>
Let me clarify...<br>
<br>
I've been fucked over really hard in all of my recent relationships, so I'm not looking for one. I'm a bright guy, college grad, nice and not sketchy in the least. I love BBWs and I want to be able to find one as a FWB. I mean that in all senses of the phrase: A good friendship with sex, just no relationship component.<br>
<br>
About me: 5'11" 225lb caucasian, educated, 25 years old. I get that doing this via craigslist is a bit weird so any amount of getting-to-know-you phase is totally fine. Looking for someone roughly my age. Just get in contact with me and we'll take it from there.

If you are a genuine female who desires an ongoing arrangement with a sincere, respectful and considerate gentleman, you are reading the right post. <br>
<br>
This type of relationship will be mutually beneficial where we help each other out. I know the current economic downturn and dismal job market has created tremendous stress on many hard working people like you and I feel for you. I hope this will lead to a warm friendship in which you can find a peace of mind. <br>
<br>
You will be meeting with a clean, safe, sane, fit, slim, healthy, educated and generous business professional in his 40s who has helped someone else in the past. He has a good heart and wants to be your friend with whom you can share your life story. <br>
<br>
It is preferably that you are a white female in your 20s or early 30s with a slim build. You will never be judged in any way and you will not be pressured into anything you don't feel comfortable with, I assure you. <br>
<br>
I hope to hear from you and stay positive! Please add the word Friendship in the subject line of your message to confirm that you are not a spammer.<br>

I am 28,recently single,420 friendly no baggage, drama or games, 5'11, 165 lbs, have been called kind, sweet, generous, fun, handsome, adorable and a nice gentleman.<br>
<br>
Being recently single and busy with work, i just don't have time for the dating bar scene or the games involved to find my sweet baby girl princess and sunshine.<br>
<br>
I am interested in a white sweetheart ,preferably 420 friendly, under the age of 29 for a on going monogamous relationship who is mature for her age and prefers a cool boyfriend that knows how to treat a girl like a lady and support her emotionally intimately financially like a real man is suppose to take care of you.<br>
<br>
I take good care of myself and being healthy and fit is very important to me.No overweight BBW'S please.<br>
<br>
This is a perfect relationship for a college student that wants to concentrate on her education and spend her free time and weekends with me being loved cherished adored pampered spoiled. Or just a unemployed home body type that would rather stay home and work on her tan then work a thankless job. And you could always go to a fashion design school art school or cosmetology school a few days a week if you get bored.<br>
<br>
I am into Photography, artsy stuff. I also enjoy weekend cruise ships to Mexico. I enjoy getting dressed up for nice nights on the town fine dining, concerts, shows, comedy clubs. road trips to Las Vegas or LA. And of course taking my baby girl shopping so she looks good feels good and does good and is the envy of all the girls looking hot.<br>
<br>
Please send pictures and the basic info listed below with your first email please to get us off to a good start. I'm not into endless back and forth emails or games.<br>
<br>
Please tell me,<br>
<br>
Where about you live ?<br>
<br>
Age height weight etc ????<br>
<br>
Living/school/work situation ???<br>
<br>
Single ? Kids ?<br>
<br>
You must be single ! If you are married or have a boyfriend please do not contact me.<br>

I'm a guy who's in financial difficulty with work and am extremely talented at sex.  I have good size and stamina and can give you an hour of oral and an hour of very good sex, good size, or any combination of foreplay you want, making out, massage, foot massage, anything.  I'm above average looking but normal, a guy next door, 6"2, 220, work out, linebacker frame, white, brown hair and eyes, educated, went to Cal.  My value is that I'm extremely good at what I do.  I'm not cheap but my service is for 2.5-3 hours and is very thorough and wonderful.  I'm not looking for women at a convention or tourists or thrill-seekers because one time, honestly, isn't worth it for me.  I like to get to know a woman and serve you for a year or several, I've had clients last over 3 years, twice a month.  If you are looking for someone who can secretly make you very happy sexually, email me.  Open to any age or race, but must be STD free and really able to afford this long-term.  If you are bored and want to spend your Christmas bonus, skip this, I need a long-term generous lady to help me through a rough patch.  In return I'll be the best lover you ever had.

A friend I can grow to love <br>
A lover I can befriend<br>
Gentle persuasion, kind coersion, joy and love and laughter throughout.<br>
I'm 48 SBM seeking a spirited soul laced with an abundance of wisdom, someone who truly enjoys getting out there and engaging in life, being in nature.<br>
I enjoy all things artistic, wide open spaces, learning, exploring, people watching and being active, I am looking to take the slow approach towards something meaning, fulfilling, warm and nurturing. <br>
<br>
It's all about a comfortable simplicity for me, if you care to take the ride, journey along, call shot-gun, feel free to get back to me at your leisure drop some knowledge about yourself, include a pictorial if you like and I'll stamp your ticket and we can be on our way. Race and dress size is unimportant to me, just keep it really real and things will flow just fine.<br>

I've spent a lot of time in the last few years thinking about the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I know she's challenging. Many men are intimidated by her smarts, her wit, her power. They rarely see her in full. They note her style and her intellect but they often miss the romantic just beneath. And she's anything but conventional. And that applies to all aspects of her life. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Okay, I've hooked you with a snappy headline and a few paragraphs, but after all, you are looking for me and you want to know why you would want to put fingers to keyboard (hey, I'd prefer a handwritten letter sealed in wax but this is the age we live in) and respond to me. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Here's why: <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I get it. It took awhile, but I finally know what works for me and why I would work for someone else. I'm a cynic. And I'm a romantic. You're probably the same way and thus you understand completely all the holy <br>
<br>
hell that creates over time. You've been through relationships, you've loved and you've broken hearts and you've had yours broken. Yet through it all there's a light that still shines brightly, a belief that with the right person, and a consciousness to make it work, you can have <br>
<br>
everything you ever wanted and more. We are but a short time on this <br>
<br>
planet and at the end of our lives what we will remember and value is <br>
<br>
the love we have shared, in all its messy, unpredictably glory. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Those moments where you feel the fingers graze your hip slightly, the moments when your eyes fill with tears, the moments when you can't stop laughing. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And you, being the cynical romantic that you are, know how fucking hard it is to find someone you want to share that with. All the factors that <br>
<br>
go into the equation: the intellectual balance. Not someone you necessarily share all the same interests and passions but someone with a <br>
<br>
full life, strong opinions, original thought, quirks, someone who can <br>
<br>
both teach and learn. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And there's humor. You know how deadly it is when the humor doesn't <br>
<br>
mesh, when they just don't quite understand why something is funny and you have that sinking feeling they never will. Humor gets us through the times we can't stand each other (and those times will be thankfully <br>
<br>
rare) and smoothes the way back to kissing and fucking. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Emotional compatibility. We both have strong wills. We will be at odds <br>
<br>
at times. But we both have enough invested, we both have the maturity to realize conflict should be short, common ground and solutions sought and <br>
<br>
that it's never a good idea to go to bed angry. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sexual compatibility. If you're like me, and I'd imagine you are, this <br>
<br>
is vital. Heat is vital for romance and it's a wildcard that needs to be <br>
<br>
there in the hand we play together. And there's no way we can figure it <br>
<br>
out except in person. <br>
<br>
I am on the assertive side sexually, imaginative, verbal and generous.<br>
<br>
What we can figure out here is a shared desire for something intense, something hot, something that stirs the hips as well <br>
<br>
as the head and the heart. I want a lover I can share everything with, <br>
<br>
try everything with, and enjoy every minute of it with. I know you can't <br>
<br>
build a relationship just around sex. I also know you can't build a romance without it. And kissing is a must. Lots of kissing. <br>
<br>
Shared values. This means we have a certain basic level of responsibility. And we share certain philosophical beliefs. We don't drive drunk, freak out over minor things, vote Republican or fill out those Scientology surveys. We try and stay healthy. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We like to touch and <br>
<br>
 be touched. Aesthetics are important, as is a certain hedonistic streak to go with the hard work. High brow and low brow are both given proper <br>
<br>
consideration. I won't think you any less an intellectual for reading In <br>
<br>
Style on the plane and John Cheever and the Ramones are both in the <br>
<br>
pantheon of the greats. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We like art, film, literature, music of all <br>
<br>
sorts, good food and nature. You'll take a tango lesson with me, and you'll challenge me, and vice versa, towards new experiences, new ways of thinking. You'll let me make you breakfast in bed and not feel guilty <br>
<br>
 at all. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Yes, yes, but who the hell are you, I hear you saying. Well, I won't <br>
<br>
show you all my cards immediately (this is the point where you start <br>
<br>
picturing me with a hunchback). I think you should know that I've never been married, I have no children, I reside in the city of San Francisco and I am gainfully employed. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There, that narrows it down to 200,000 men. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'm Caucasian, I'm a writer and I'm an Agnostic and yet I believe on <br>
<br>
some basic level of the strange power of the random meeting. My parents met on a blind date. Not that meeting this way is completely random. I want to find you. I know the odds of meeting you at a gallery opening or a bookstore or the local dive are less than promising and I'm tired of being patient. And this way I know something touched a nerve. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I am well-aware that a posting like this puts a bit more pressure on a <br>
<br>
first meeting than the usual "let's get a drink and see if we want to <br>
<br>
grope" posting. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We both know <br>
<br>
that if the sparks are there things will progress, butterflies will ensue and who knows after that. I'm under no illusion that you're perfect and I know I'm not. And yes, the seemingly charming affectations tend to devolve into little irritants as the months and years go by, but I know that a certain fundamental commitment makes for a depth that is rare and wonderful. A partnership that makes us both different, better, <br>
<br>
and often outrageously happy. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I can't wait to hear all about you.

I am well-aware that a posting like this puts a bit more pressure on a <br>
<br>
first meeting than the usual "let's get a drink and see if we want to <br>
<br>
grope" posting. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We both know <br>
<br>
that if the sparks are there things will progress, butterflies will ensue and who knows after that. I'm under no illusion that you're perfect and I know I'm not. And yes, the seemingly charming affectations tend to devolve into little irritants as the months and years go by, but I know that a certain fundamental commitment makes for a depth that is rare and wonderful. A partnership that makes us both different, better, <br>
<br>
and often outrageously happy. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I can't wait to hear all about you.

Hope that title didn't sound too creepy.<br>
<br>
It's just that in my experience, those 'good girl' types on the outside are so invigorating and adventurous behind closed doors...<br>
<br>
I just got out of a long relationship and I'm trying something new...so I thought I would take a chance and see if CL has the wondering eyes of someone who wants what I am seeking for.<br>
<br>
How about either I come to you, or you come to me...we perhaps chat a bit...maybe have a drink...then we get totally into each other....making out...massage, touching, licking, sucking, oral both ways...you get the idea!<br>
<br>
If you're into stats: I am 6'0", 175, athletic, short hair, cute eyes, clean and yes...totally shaven.<br>
<br>
I look forward to hearing form you.<br>
<br>
Please include a pic and description of yourself as well.<br>
<br>
So that I know you're real...I want you to tell me the ONE THING you want to have done to you behind closed doors...yet shy to ask someone you know well...but might be willing to let a stranger do. :)

I like to go down on a woman for an hour, focus on your pleasure.  I am very good at cunnilingus, good oral stamina, combine nipple touching and tongue/lip motions on your clit, lick you with a flat tongue inside out over the clit.  And I know all women are different so whatever you order, I'll deliver.  I'm nice-looking and discreet.  I am OK with shaved or with hair, if you are in a stage of not having sex for a few months but would like to receive a pussy licking, get horny and don't feel comfortable with sex with a stranger but are OK with receiving oral, or are in a relationship with or married to a guy who no longer does this or at least not very well, Email me.  I can be discreet.  I'm 6"3, 225, in good shape, run and lift weights, and am looking for a woman 120-170 lbs., maybe less if short, maybe more if tall but with nice legs, toned, not obese, thin, athletic or thick is fine, and an attitude, and 25-45.  I can meet for coffee first if you want to think about the idea of a guy giving you oral only once a week.  I prefer with no sex nor reciprocation, though it's your call, if you order me to do it, I'll do it, but ideal is a woman who is rude and bossy and just has me eat her out with no other activity.

Activities I enjoy include but are not limited to getting up from in front of the TV from time to time to scratch myself "down there", standing at my front door with my junk hanging out as I scope the neighborhood and wonder how the front lawn got so out of control, and generally being impatient and indignant when my partner doesn't foresee, forecast and tend to all of my emotional, physical and sexual needs in an appropriately self-less manner.<br>
You: given up on life and ready to settle. You've long ago reconciled the emotional disappointment that comes from realizing that mom was wrong: there isn't someone out there for you. Never the less, you try to keep it up-beat for my sake. You don't nag, you never want to go dancing and have zero aspirations to see the world, learn new things or engage your peers in meaningful social interaction.<br>

thanks for reading. Now be quiet and go make make me a sandwich.<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm a single male: intelligent, outgoing, fun guy, with a good sense of humor. I'm looking for someone fun, attractive and in good shape<br>
It would be nice to find someone else to have some fun in the bedroom, and possibly out if we could make it work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you honestly too busy to be in a relationship, due to school/work, or just not in the place right now. And are you honestly single? But at the same time you'd like an ongoing sexual experience, because lets face it sex is calming and destressing, and feels amazing. But................ you don't want to have a one-night stands, and you can't have a boyfriend. That's like me but from a guy's point of view ................ What do you think?<br>
<br>
<br>
If you email, include a picture, don't be shy, so say something about yourself (I'm not just a piece of meat you know)<br>
I'm open to all races/ages as long as you have a fun personality, and are attractive and in shape<br>
<br>
<br>
Email me if you think we're on the same page I do have face pictures( and am not overly vain at all) and i will send once we interact over emails<br>

This appears to be the best place to try to find a cute girl looking for the same thing as me, a friend with benefits. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I recently got out of a serious relationship and miss the physical aspect. I don't think I am ready to jump into another relationship right at this time, but I also don't want to sleep around with a bunch of people. So, here I am looking for a FWB. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
About me, I am a professional guy who works downtown. I am in good shape and stay active. I am normal, totally clean, and only play safe. I am clean-cut, white and am hoping to find an equally cute girl interested in safe fun. I am not opposed to it turning into something else. I have pictures to trade and hope to hear from you:)

  About the one I'm looking for...<br>
Love comes under the least expected guises.That statement should be enough to fill this box dont you think?...Whatever...,Id expect you to be sincere,honest,trustworthy A positive person with a zest for life,a free thinker, Your race,creed,religion,age,physical appearance,eating,smoking or drinking habits...etc ...isnt of importance to me.Your character IS.I mean it .So those of you out there that society pigeonholes and labels as fat ,old and ugly,please dont let such short-sightedness stop you from writing me.I strongly believe theres much more to it than glass paper and glossy looks.Theres CHARACTER.Nothing beats character not even aging, you see(and we all know what the former does to looks-no matter what Joan Collins might say ). If you see yourself in this(and if you dont:remember the least expected guises?),then dont hesitate to write now;YOU WONT REGRET IT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A little about me...<br>
Im honest, faithful, multi-lingual, communicative, athletic, caring, dependable,one with a great sense of humour, world-traveled and focused.I feel priviledged being multi-cultural in essence<br>
Dont bother trying to explain to me what diversity is all about.It is my middle name for crying out loud!I value communication AND cross-cultural communication. <br>
. Ive got a lot of love and affection to give to the RIGHT person<br>
<br>
INTERESTS:<br>
Mind you ,my interests could fill an encyclopeadia(or your computers memory,you choose).First and foremost,I like people,yes I do .It might sound naive a statement but I still believe in the inherent good in the Human form.... I like PRACTISING sports(I am not a couch potato):bodybuiding 3 times a week,basketball once a week, soccer once a week , jogging for 3 hours early on thursdays(before work) and on Sundays . I like my work( consultant for tech companies ).I like the fact that I can work free-lance as it affords me full amplitude to bringing my ideas to fruitful conclusion without HINDERING SUPERVISION(you read me right?)<br>
 I'd just like to add...<br>
I love listening and dancing to music and Im said to be a real sensation on the dancefloor,seeming to enlighten it with my dazzling footsteps.I love reading books and scientific publications.Im a real movie buff,you know what I mean ,a REAL one.I like cooking(yes I do! ) to friends but more importantly for my special other,and then wed have a candlelit dinner with;my funny Valentine; in the background,you know, that type of thing ;no need for visuals right?I love making love to my special other Cross-cultural communication is something that really makes me tick(oh already said that right? gosh!).I love languages. I enjoy travelling,which is also the driving force behind my learning and practising foreign languages(I speak a few African languages,German, Japanese,and of course French).I find it hard to conceive of a travelling venture that doesnt include extensively exchanging with the locals.And knowing their language does help doesnt it?<br>

Love comes under the least expected guises.That statement should be enough to fill this box dont you think?...Whatever...,Id expect you to be sincere,honest,trustworthy A positive person with a zest for life,a free thinker, Your race,creed,religion,age,physical appearance,eating,smoking or drinking habits...etc ...isnt of importance to me.Your character IS.I mean it .So those of you out there that society pigeonholes and labels as fat ,old and ugly,please dont let such short-sightedness stop you from writing me.I strongly believe theres much more to it than glass paper and glossy looks.Theres CHARACTER.Nothing beats character not even aging, you see(and we all know what the former does to looks-no matter what Joan Collins might say ). If you see yourself in this(and if you dont:remember the least expected guises?),then dont hesitate to write now;YOU WONT REGRET IT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A little about me...<br>
Im honest, faithful, multi-lingual, communicative, athletic, caring, dependable,one with a great sense of humour, world-traveled and focused.I feel priviledged being multi-cultural in essence<br>
Dont bother trying to explain to me what diversity is all about.It is my middle name for crying out loud!I value communication AND cross-cultural communication. <br>
. Ive got a lot of love and affection to give to the RIGHT person<br>
<br>
INTERESTS:<br>
Mind you ,my interests could fill an encyclopeadia(or your computers memory,you choose).First and foremost,I like people,yes I do .It might sound naive a statement but I still believe in the inherent good in the Human form.... I like PRACTISING sports(I am not a couch potato):bodybuiding 3 times a week,basketball once a week, soccer once a week , jogging for 3 hours early on thursdays(before work) and on Sundays . I like my work( consultant for tech companies ).I like the fact that I can work free-lance as it affords me full amplitude to bringing my ideas to fruitful conclusion without HINDERING SUPERVISION(you read me right?)<br>
 I'd just like to add...<br>
I love listening and dancing to music and Im said to be a real sensation on the dancefloor,seeming to enlighten it with my dazzling footsteps.I love reading books and scientific publications.Im a real movie buff,you know what I mean ,a REAL one.I like cooking(yes I do! ) to friends but more importantly for my special other,and then wed have a candlelit dinner with;my funny Valentine; in the background,you know, that type of thing ;no need for visuals right?I love making love to my special other Cross-cultural communication is something that really makes me tick(oh already said that right? gosh!).I love languages. I enjoy travelling,which is also the driving force behind my learning and practising foreign languages(I speak a few African languages,German, Japanese,and of course French).I find it hard to conceive of a travelling venture that doesnt include extensively exchanging with the locals.And knowing their language does help doesnt it?<br>

Long ago a friend and I were discussing women and kind of women attracts us. I posed the question: "If you were a woman what kind of woman would you be??"<br>
<br>
My friend replied: "I would be a whore." <br>
<br>
He then asked me: "If you were a woman, what kind of woman would YOU be?? <br>
<br>
I responded without hestitation: "I'd be a lesbian." <br>
<br>
He responded with a nod, "Because you like women."  We toasted.<br>
<br>
I have latent homosexual desires, as we all do.  And we all express them in our varied and culturally accepted ways.  But in my opinion, men are gross, and too unhygienic to interact with sexually and sensually.  I know.  I used to be one of them, and I still see them on occasion in the gym, on the streets, in bars, restaurants, public transportation, and more.<br>
<br>
For me, to express my homosexuality, I like to play a passive role, from time to time, to play the feminine role, to relinquish control.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I am seeking a woman.  This woman can be straight, bisexual, a lesbian, a dyke, a butch, or a femme, with or without, a strap-on dildo. <br>
<br>
I would also like to learn the finer art of cunilingus...your way, as only a woman truly knows how to satisfy another woman. <br>

Are you single? I am as also and although I'm basically fine with it, I want a girlfriend for at least the next several weeks. If we find ourselves still pining for each other next year. . .then lucky us! <br>
<br>
We can start enjoying each other immediately for things like holiday parties, middle of the week dancing, dinners/cooking and possibly even travel. If you're crafty, we can spend much too much time making holiday thing-a-ma-jigs with a glass of wine or home brewed chai nearby. Regarding travel, I would like to take two trips over the next six weeks and you're invited to come. I'm thinking tropical destinations that have big warm oceans to swim in.<br>
<br>
Ready? Well put down your career/art project/volunteer work and take a break from yoga for a night so we can meet this weekend. It's gorgeous out! Send over your picture and a brief note about why this sounds appealing.<br>
<br>
I'm 6'2", slender, fit, attractive, mischievous, modest, secure and ready. <br>

Evening ladies, I am a divorced male, who lives in the Bay Area. I have my own business, and have to spend most of my time, operating it. I have decided to not just try to survive this economic downturn, but to succeed in it. Because of my drive, and unwillingness to let my hard work barely make ends meet, I have sacrificed my social life. I am a very upfront, down to earth guy. I am a man's man, who loves the outdoors, and working with my hands. I am athletic, participating in sports mainly Baseball, Football, as a kid, all the way into my early adult life. Even though I am 40, people always question my age, simply from my appearance. I am HWP leaning towards the muscular. I have broad shoulders and am physically and mentally strong. I am compassionate and very intuitive, I am a great listener, and can give solid advice to those who ask for it. My greatest asset is my laid back outlook, I only am interested in what you want to share with me, so I never pry. I don't sweat the small stuff, and I guarantee that I will never try to change you.....What I will do is tell you the truth, be upfront, and never lie. The relationship I am seeking depends on our ability to be truthful without worry of hurting the other person's feelings.<br>
<br>
I am seeking a woman who may be struggling to make ends meet. She may be separated or divorced, and is on her own for the first time in years, and just needs that little bit of help. I am also open to meeting students, if you are mature in mind. I don't mean you are more mature than your friends, I mean you can relate to someone my age. Maybe you are a woman for whatever reason, has had horrible luck with men, you are almost tired of our bullshit, and choose not to deal with it. However, you still have your needs to be fulfilled and you prefer to have them with someone you are friends with. Perhaps you are a woman, who lives comfortably, you can pay your mortgage/rent on time, you don't eat ramen for dinner, and your clothes are not a decade old. You make good money, enough to live in the Bay Area, but if you had a little more, you would be able to join your friends on that trip to Hawaii......This is also perfect for a woman who enjoys the company of a man, without any of the drama or worries of commitment.....Whatever your situation, you may be interested in what I propose.<br>
<br>
What I am offering is an arrangement, where your time is compensated for. This compensation could be many different things, it would have to be discussed and agreed upon. If you are interested, then send me an email which describes what you are looking for. Once you feel comfortable, you can send a picture of yourself. G rated photos are preferred, as the explicit ones are taken as being spam, and deleted. If we have a little connection, then I would propose to meet for a drink and see if that connection has some chemistry. If there is chemistry, then we can begin discussing the compensation that would be arranged. I would like to see you once a week, for several hours. This could include dinner/lunch at a restaurant, a shopping trip that you deserve, it just depends on what we decide to do. If the chemistry is there, then weekend trips would be offered. If you are interested, then later on, possibly a vacation to a destination you have always wanted to go to. I am thinking about going to Australia in February, maybe you may want to come along for the whole three weeks, or maybe just for one....<br>
<br>
When replying, please type in the words "Take me Away" in the subject line. ALL emails without this get deleted. It's my experience, that women who are serious, read the ad a few times, just to make sure they make the right decision to reply...so they always type the subject line correctly<br>
<br>
Don't forget**********************type "Take me Away" in the subject line of your email********************************************************<br>

For all others good luck in what you are searching for.

Evening ladies, I am a divorced male, who lives in the Bay Area. I have my own business, and have to spend most of my time, operating it. I have decided to not just try to survive this economic downturn, but to succeed in it. Because of my drive, and unwillingness to let my hard work barely make ends meet, I have sacrificed my social life. I am a very upfront, down to earth guy. I am a man's man, who loves the outdoors, and working with my hands. I am athletic, participating in sports mainly Baseball, Football, as a kid, all the way into my early adult life. Even though I am 40, people always question my age, simply from my appearance. I am HWP leaning towards the muscular. I have broad shoulders and am physically and mentally strong. I am compassionate and very intuitive, I am a great listener, and can give solid advice to those who ask for it. My greatest asset is my laid back outlook, I only am interested in what you want to share with me, so I never pry. I don't sweat the small stuff, and I guarantee that I will never try to change you.....What I will do is tell you the truth, be upfront, and never lie. The relationship I am seeking depends on our ability to be truthful without worry of hurting the other person's feelings.<br>
<br>
I am seeking a woman who may be struggling to make ends meet. She may be separated or divorced, and is on her own for the first time in years, and just needs that little bit of help. I am also open to meeting students, if you are mature in mind. I don't mean you are more mature than your friends, I mean you can relate to someone my age. Maybe you are a woman for whatever reason, has had horrible luck with men, you are almost tired of our bullshit, and choose not to deal with it. However, you still have your needs to be fulfilled and you prefer to have them with someone you are friends with. Perhaps you are a woman, who lives comfortably, you can pay your mortgage/rent on time, you don't eat ramen for dinner, and your clothes are not a decade old. You make good money, enough to live in the Bay Area, but if you had a little more, you would be able to join your friends on that trip to Hawaii......This is also perfect for a woman who enjoys the company of a man, without any of the drama or worries of commitment.....Whatever your situation, you may be interested in what I propose.<br>

I'm looking for my very own Mrs.Robinson. I have been attracted to older women since I was 17, but have only recently begun to act on it. I'm looking for more than a one night stand, but at the same time don't want a friend, who is going to freak out if I don't call her every night. Somewhere in between. Chemistry is paramount. I am professional, educated, in good shape, etc. My ideal female is 45 to 65. If you're an open-minded older woman, who has always wanted a younger man, then let's talk.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
P.S. I'm married to a woman my age. So, you should either be married yourself or be open to doing this with a married younger man.

Hi there, I am a good looking, funny and intelligent Italian guy (Made in Italy) with a professional job. I am an honest person, down-to-earth, and easy to get along with - more you get to know me, more you will like me ....100% money back guaranteed ;-) <br>
<br>
If you are like me who enjoys to travel the world, than we should talk :) <br>
<br>
I little more about me: <br>
I am adventurous - I love to travel the world <br>
I am romantic - I am Italian after all :) <br>
I am passionate - in and out the bed <br>
I am very caring - I would do anything for the love of my life (unless she wants me to give up Nutella :) <br>
I am positive and have very good family values - I would like to have 15 kids . . .just kidding <br>
I am real and get along with real and honest people. <br>
I am 5.11 and nice built - I try to work out 3 times a week (because I eat a lot of pasta) <br>
<br>
What I am looking for: A girl between age 28 and 38 who takes good care of herself. Funny, friendly, down to heart, and who can appreciate the simple things in life <br>
<br>
A plus if you are: <br>
A positive person <br>
A giver <br>
Into fashion /style (since I am) <br>
<br>
Well, if you are ready to take a journey with an authentic and romantic Italian guy (who also knows how to cook good Italian food) then I would love to hear from you. <br>
<br>
BTW - The reason why I decided to put an ad on CL is because, fortunately-unfortunately I don't like "picking up girls" at bars :-) and kind of sick of the scene. <br>
<br>
Ciao, <br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. I am open to any background - White, Asian (Korean, Japanese, Philippine, . . .. . .) Latin (Brazilian, Colombian, Peruvian, Argentinean, . . ..), European (Italia, Spanish, French, . . .. . .. . .), Persian, or . . .. . .. . .. . .. . . <br>
Equal opportunity employment here LOL<br>

Hello,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not new to Craigslist. I have posted ads on here with little to no luck. However, I still hold on to hope that I might meet someone....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I just turned 35 and I am thinking it might be time to actually settle down, date, have fun, and be open to the possibility of finding someone to co-exist with. My life is wonderful - I have a great apartment, a job I love, a dog who makes me laugh and some amazing friends. The only thing lacking is companionship with a woman.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some Basic Info:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- 5'7, 175, heavily tattooed (sleeves), have an awesome beard,  blue eyes, liberal in appearance, though not a hipster...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Love the outdoors. Camp regularly. Hike often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Have a companion canine, sweet lab/pit mix<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Spiritual, not religious, meditate regularly, believe there is something bigger than me<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Alcohol and drug-free ( sober 3+ years) - though have no issues with other people enjoying themselves in moderation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Smoker. Fire at one end, fool at the other...Hope to curb this habit soon though.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Well read. Authors I enjoy: Henry Miller, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Vonnegut, Paul Bowles, Borges, DeLillo, Cormac McCarthy, Murakami, etc etc etc<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Well traveled. Have been to all of the lower-48, Europe, North Africa, Turkey. Plan to visit India next.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Computer geek by day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- I have a green thumb. I love plants, especially orchids.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Hopelessly addicted to caffeine<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Sports fan. Love the Giants. Love the Saints.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Originally from New Orleans. Katrina survivor. Miss NO, but SF is home now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Plan to buy an old house and fix it up in the next 5 years - either in the Santa Cruz mountains or Guerneville.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- I play the accordion, though not very well (yet)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- I am a little odd.  I have little-to-no "filter" and will always say what is on my mind. Most of my friends find this to be an endearing trait...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- I love to makeout - and I am good at it!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So if any of this interests you - email me. Will happily exchange photos.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Bonus points if you know what my title is referencing!

- I am a little odd.  I have little-to-no "filter" and will always say what is on my mind. Most of my friends find this to be an endearing trait...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- I love to makeout - and I am good at it!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So if any of this interests you - email me. Will happily exchange photos.<br>

Hello ladies. <br>
<br>
That's me, below. How are you today? <br>
<br>
I am writing to the collective you because... well, you know why. I mean, it's the same reason you are here reading these posts, isn't it? my hope, of course, is to impress only one of you - what we all call the "right" one - to whip up her email account and shoot me back a note that will grab my attention, lead to more exchanges, an actual meeting in person, butterflies, kisses, touching, sharing, growing, and learning about each other... you know, falling in love. <br>
<br>
But it doesn't work that way, does it? you're already wondering what kind of weirdo I am, stating the obvious like that. But see, it's hard to stand out these days. Sure, I could tell you that I'm tall, and reasonably fit, and moderately successful, and thirty nine, and two ten, but that's just a bunch of trivia, soon forgotten. And it is when I admit that I am divorced and a proud dad of two wonderful children that I lose half of you at the outset.<br>
<br>
That's alright, though, because the entire concept here is reaching a large audience. And I'm only looking for one. <br>
<br>
No, it's when I actually move into more life stuff that it happens. That poppoing sound as the virtual room you share with all those other eyeballs gets empty so fast it's like it entered a vacuum. Which is a shame, really, because everyone around me thinks that the one who does come to the table will be one real lucky gal (their words, not mine). Well, to be fair, that's what they tell me, I can't say for certain what they think. Maybe they are all just trying to make me feel better. Boy, that sure would suck, wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
So here it is. The big nasty secret, the skeleton in the closet, the thing. I live with my ex-wife.<br>
<br>
(waiting patiently)<br>
<br>
For the three of you still reading this, it's a choice we both made because of... well, can you guess? yes, the kids. We have no notion of getting back together, she is not a threat, and heck, her boyfriend stays with us for a couple weeks at a time. It's not fixed in stone, just where we are at present. It's a big house, we occupy opposite ends of it, and are thinking of building an expansion to make it work more like a duplex, but I'd rather not sign up for that without input from the proverbial you. For now, it works for us. We're really good friends, not in the way that people usually say "I'm real good friends with my ex" meaning "we can have a two-minute logistics conversation about the kids without blowing our tops", but in the affectionate and occasionally irritated way that siblings often interact. They will be getting married next year, she and her boyfriend, and I'll be the one walking her down the aisle, and if you stop for a moment to think about it, you might realize it's a wonderful testament to our capacity as human beings to resolve conflict, care for others, and put the greater good above ourselves. <br>
<br>
I only mention that last part because it will also apply to you, should you be that girl. <br>
<br>
And that's it. I have no real vices. I'm clean, in both the STD way and in the general sense of hygene. I don't smoke, do druge, drink, destructively gamble, or care that much about sports I can't particpate in myself. You know what that means? that when everybody else is watching the superbowl or whatever, we can be out having fun with each other. Maybe flying somewhere to do it, for you see, I am also a private pilot. I am, established to a degree by the implied aspects of the decision above, the farthest thing you can imagine from a deadbeat. I absolutely love and adore my kids, and am considered, or at least told by those same people who tell me how lucky you will be, that I am an incredible father. I am very well compensated for what expertise I possess in my field, which is in turn rather well recognized. I am a geek, but quite the social one, which can throw people off, but in a good way. Curiosity and an incessant drive for growth and self-awareness guide much of my behavior in life, and I like to think that these are not bad things.<br>
<br>
So is there one of you left? are there things I am asking of you? yes. A picture, for one. Not suggestive, definitely not naked, but something that lets me have a good sense of what you look like, because shallow as it might appear at first glance, I am rather determined that attraction of the physical kind is absolutely necessary to make anything work long-term. Tell me about you. Tell me why you're here. Put the word "Nefarious" in your email subject line so I know you're human. If you can figure out how to make it work in the context of your note, all the better.<br>
<br>
Oh, who am I kidding? I am writing to myself by now. Or am I?

Hello ladies. <br>
<br>
That's me, below. How are you today? <br>
<br>
I am writing to the collective you because... well, you know why. I mean, it's the same reason you are here reading these posts, isn't it? my hope, of course, is to impress only one of you - what we all call the "right" one - to whip up her email account and shoot me back a note that will grab my attention, lead to more exchanges, an actual meeting in person, butterflies, kisses, touching, sharing, growing, and learning about each other... you know, falling in love. <br>
<br>
But it doesn't work that way, does it? you're already wondering what kind of weirdo I am, stating the obvious like that. But see, it's hard to stand out these days. Sure, I could tell you that I'm tall, and reasonably fit, and moderately successful, and thirty nine, and two ten, but that's just a bunch of trivia, soon forgotten. And it is when I admit that I am divorced and a proud dad of two wonderful children that I lose half of you at the outset.<br>
<br>
That's alright, though, because the entire concept here is reaching a large audience. And I'm only looking for one. <br>
<br>
No, it's when I actually move into more life stuff that it happens. That poppoing sound as the virtual room you share with all those other eyeballs gets empty so fast it's like it entered a vacuum. Which is a shame, really, because everyone around me thinks that the one who does come to the table will be one real lucky gal (their words, not mine). Well, to be fair, that's what they tell me, I can't say for certain what they think. Maybe they are all just trying to make me feel better. Boy, that sure would suck, wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
So here it is. The big nasty secret, the skeleton in the closet, the thing. I live with my ex-wife.<br>
<br>
(waiting patiently)<br>
<br>

This is the first time I have ventured into the online dating scene so with a little trepidation here goes..... I don't believe that the key to success in a relationship is finding someone exactly like me, as people are all different, but I'll list some of what I like and what I don't like so we'll know if we are somewhat on the same page!<br>
<br>
Likes: Horses, dogs, cats, the smell of fresh cut grass, open minded, altruistic people, Seinfeld, 30 Rock, The Office, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Rene Russo, Russell Crowe, Monica Belluci, Elvis Costello, R and B, French Chillout Lounge music, Jazz and most other music apart from gang banger Hip Hop, having a few drinks and a good time, good restaurants, good kissers, witty people with a dry sense of humor, being goofy, Eddie Izzard, Eddie Murphy, Amsterdam, Costa Rica, New York City, San Francisco, Point Reyes, Sushi, Thai and Italian food, blue sky, the scent of early fall in the Bay Area.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dislikes: Snakes, of both the reptilian and human variety, people who cheat, people who are clueless about stuff yet still make judgements about it, Matthew McConaughey, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, racists, bigots, people whose politics are a product of their bank balance rather than their mind, Sarah Palin, and I am extremely suspicious of anyone who doesn't like dogs.<br>
<br>
What I Do: I'm an entrepeneur and have been self employed for the past ten years. I've had my own recruiting business for a while and I'm currently working on developing a horse industry related business. I am orinally from the UK and have been living in Calfornia since the late 90s.<br>
<br>
What I Look Like: 5'9, 175, Not Bald,(!), in good shape, I'm hopefully sexier than I am good looking, but isn't it better to be sexy? :) Yeah Baby!!!  I'd optimistically give me 7 out of 10 on looks, and I will make you laugh. <br>
<br>
What I think about: The Universe, what this is all about, where my Mum has gone to and where we are all going too. Why other drivers don't let you out when they see you are desperate to change lanes. Why my dog still hasn't spoken to me in English when I am convinced that he can. Why I don't read more. The damage that dogmatic patriotism and religion can do to the world. And lots more...<br>
<br>
What I am looking for: I am open to both a casual relationship or a long term relationship. Ideally you should be smart, 35 to 40, an animal lover, a democrat, in good shape with a great sense of humor. If you have kids that's fine, if you don't that's fine too, I am completely open to the possibility of having a family but it is not a must. If you are a smoker, or obsessed with People magazine and Entertainment Tonight, a church lady or an extreme tree hugger, it won't work. If you are jaded, believe that all guys are the same and will never share the same confidences with your guy that you would with your girlfriends, it won't work. If you are looking for a best friend as well as someone you can lust after, if you value, offer and give trust and respect, we should talk :).<br>
<br>
If you are interested email me and let me know about you, and we can take it from there. <br>

It's been years since I had a partner and I've liked the independence, the exploring of what my life has really meant for me, my personal connection with the world etc.But now, I'd really like a friend/partner or at least some warm company on my Birthday!<br>
I'm 48, close to 6' , medium built , east Indian, spiritually inclined, have had success/wealth and also lived on the streets. No drugs, alcohol etc, clean.Just someone <br>
who loves to live from the heart/ soul.<br>
I'm interested in concerts ( western/indian classical or if you have a nice idea I'm always willing to explore). Theater, movies, hiking, walking on the beach, <br>
cars, playing drums, cooking (you cook/ I can help! ), creating a good living space etc.<br>
Well this gives you the jist I hope,and I'm Sag (Sagitarrian ) of course from my birthdate, if you look into things like that too.<br>
I'm looking for someone sweet, straightforward, attractive , kind personality. I make a good friend, and if things work out, I am also a loyal, steady long term partner.<br>
Thanks for reading, and hope you're having a good/great holiday season.<br>
Hope to hear from you soon.

I'm looking for my soul-mate - my one true love...<br>
<br>
That means a lover - a confidant. <br>
<br>
So why not start there?<br>
<br>
Way smart (formally educated too), dang fit, traveled, articulate. <br>
<br>
About 6+ / 185, clean cut (and squeaky clean).<br>
<br>
Capable of managing a formal place setting with alacrity. <br>
<br>
Your social standing, age, race is secondary to chemistry. <br>
<br>
(Having said that - If you're a trophy Asian gal deciding on the interior of your new private plane I'll bump you to the head of the line......) <br>
<br>
Tell me about you - photos a re always welcome....<br>
<br>
( What's with all the SPAM on CL? If you're not, and are serious - then send a photo and put 'kissable' in the title - please. ) <br>

I am 6'2 tall, no kids, I don't smoke, I am pretty laid back and open minded about most things.  I am just looking to meet someone and see what happens I don't expect much but would love to go out and see what happens.  I live alone, educated, and love to have fun in the house or out.  I haven't lived in the area too long so I am looking to meet someone through here.  <br>
<br>
What I am looking for:<br>
I would like to meet a woman who is smaller than me, I like women who are 5'8 and under. I would prefer someone local but I don't mind San Jose area since I  am in the area all the time during the week. I am open to an most ages as long as she is comfortable with the age difference I will be as well.  I have dated all races, just looking for a woman who is just willing to reply and really meet in person, we can take it from there.  I think we will find out more if we click by meeting and seeing how we feel in person rather than trying to exchange 100 emails.  So if you are interested feel free to reply and I will be sure to respond.  Please send a picture of yourself and I will send you more pictures of myself <br>
<br>
Thanks

<br>
I'm looking for a reasonable and good-hearted girl (regardless of race) to establish an HONEST, STABLE and FAITHFUL relationship that could <br>
lead to something more! An open-minded girl, respectful, tolerable, in shape (take good care of her body) and caring is the one I seek.<br>
Please be under 32 yrs. Race and Religion doesn't matter...we're all people and deserve love and respect<br>
<br>
I'm NOT looking for sex (although I'm good at it and love it), but something beyond sex, which is LOVE and COMPANIONSHIP.<br>
<br>
Me: an ambitious, caring, calm and laid-back gentleman with good head on my shoulders, have my own place and have a lot going for me in life. <br>
I'm about 5'10" and 181lbs...mostly muscle weight ...athletic and very fit. I work full-time and I'm also pursuing my masters in Biochemistry!<br>
I'm the kind of guy you can take home and introduce to your parents and friends.<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from you ..I AM A REAL PERSON! NO FAKERS PLEASE!!!<br>

I'm an ambitious, caring, calm and laid-back gentleman with good head on my shoulders, have my own place and have a lot going for me in life. <br>
I'm about  5'10" and 181lbs...mostly muscle weight ...athletic and very fit. I work full-time and I'm also pursuing my masters in Biochemistry!<br>
I'm the kind of guy you can take home and introduce to your parents and friends.<br>

I'm looking for a reasonable and good-hearted girl (regardless of race) to establish an HONEST, STABLE and FAITHFUL relationship that could <br>

Let's watch a good movie, get stoned and be silly. No pressure or expectations. I am very open minded, 6 ft, 175, enjoy classic rock, good movies, swimming, chatting and much more. What I really care about is your personality, intelligence and sense of humor. I don't care about your looks or weight although I do enjoy nice boobies. It's a nice day and I can't think of a better way to spend it than getting to know you. I am open to a LTR if we really like each other and have chemistry.

Work out daily pretty much daily (gym/running, 1/2 marathons etc), hiking/mountain climbing, snow skiing (as often as I can go) pretty much any other outdoor activities, golf, tennis.. etc..<br>

Hey...Are there any women out there that enjoy watching porn?  If so, what type of scenes do you like?<br>
<br>
I love to watch porn, and would love to find a fun lady to enjoy it with, but it seems like every ad on cl that mentions porn is some gay guy looking for other gay guys trolling for blow jobs, and I am not into that at all.<br>
<br>
I am just wondering if there are any women out there that like to watch porn.  I think it would be an interesting thing to have in common to make a new friend...you never know what might come up.  It might be a really great time.<br>
<br>
Please reply if you have an opinion or comment.  I am always interested to know how women think about this.<br>
<br>
Thanks

I would like to give a wonderful sensual massage to a sexy woman that would appreciate the attention of a man totally worshiping her body.  I am not expecting any kind of sexual favors, just be open to receiving a wonderful rejuvenating touch.  Let me gently massage your scalp and face, gently but firmly rub your back and shoulders until all the tension disappears.  Let me massage your feet and calves and thighs until you melt into complete relaxation.  This massage is all about you, relaxing, indulging, enjoying every stroke of my hands as they caress your beautiful body.  You decide how much and how long you want to feel the touch and care of a truly compassionate man that only wants to give pleasure to you.  No time schedule, no expectations, and no fee...just pure relaxation, appreciation, and bliss.  Please contact me to make your appointment today.

I am looking for someone to spend some time with on my Yacht on the weekends. Keep going out alone and getting tired of it. Seems to be very difficult to find someone the conventional ways or even dating site. Thought I would try CL.<br>
A woman, young at heart, likes boating or would like to learn about boating and is free spirited, open minded and fun. Boating is fun. Likes to eat drink and be merry, sun tanning and relaxing is the mode here. Always 5 oclock. Not just a visitor, I would like to get to know someone well. This is my home part of the time so you need to be welcome, also mello. Get your own cabin and bath. <br>
Pic will get you started. <br>

Looking for a gal 18-37.  If you have kids it's not a problem as I have some too (2 who live with mama most of the time).  Looking for a girl who's honest and trustworthy.  I'm a hardworking individual who is looking to fill his afernoons with a girl who likes to hang out at home or go to a movie once in a while or walk around the mall, go out to dinner, whatever I'll do just about anything.  I enjoy riding my mountain bike, helping my kids learn to read, Cooking and baking are also in my skill set.  I'm college educated and I have a good work ethic.  I have goals and wish to return to school.  I'm not the jealous type and understand that you have friends.  I ask for the same respect.  If your tired of games and are seeking a guy who understands that having a relationship requires patients for it to bloom into something beautiful, well here I am waiting for you.  I'm hispanic (bilingual) 6' ft tall  215lbs. Average build (I got little love handles :-P)  Long black thick curly hair I have it tied up most of the time.  I'll send you a picture just ask for one.  Just for reference ladies I was with my ex for 12yrs, so I am looking for something long term, and it's been over 3 years since i've left her so there wont be any baby momma drama lol.  I hope I've done a good job describing myself and what I'm looking for in a gal.  Hope to hear from you soon.<br>
<br>
Oh and BTW i have a particular attraction to short petite women.  Don't worry ladies if your not short and petite it's not important, just a bonus if you are ;-).  My shortest girlfriend was 5'2" and my tallest girlfirend was 6'1" (without her damn shoes on!  OMFG! LOL)  But no serious hit me up if your interested.  My name is Jason Be good.

I'm a hardworking individual who is looking to fill his afernoons with a girl who likes to hang out at home or go to a movie once in a while or walk around the mall, go out to dinner, whatever I'll do just about anything.  I enjoy riding my mountain bike, helping my kids learn to read, Cooking and baking are also in my skill set.  I'm college educated and I have a good work ethic.  I have goals and wish to return to school.  I'm not the jealous type and understand that you have friends.  I ask for the same respect.  If your tired of games and are seeking a guy who understands that having a relationship requires patients for it to bloom into something beautiful, well here I am waiting for you.  I'm hispanic (bilingual) 6' ft tall  215lbs. Average build (I got little love handles :-P)  Long black thick curly hair I have it tied up most of the time.  I'll send you a picture just ask for one.  Just for reference ladies I was with my ex for 12yrs, so I am looking for something long term, and it's been over 3 years since i've left her so there wont be any baby momma drama lol.  I hope I've done a good job describing myself and what I'm looking for in a gal.  Hope to hear from you soon.<br>
<br>
Oh and BTW i have a particular attraction to short petite women.  Don't worry ladies if your not short and petite it's not important, just a bonus if you are ;-).  My shortest girlfriend was 5'2" and my tallest girlfirend was 6'1" (without her damn shoes on!  OMFG! LOL)  But no serious hit me up if your interested.  My name is Jason Be good.

Well, I'm a pretty basic 35 year old fello. I'mnot really surwe what to say here, but I'm a fitness trainer and run bootcamps throughout the city. That said, I'm probably the most laid back trainer you'll ever meet, and totally non-judgmental about fitness. I'm not looking for a triathlete (at all. no triathlete/iron women types please)).  

 While I'm not at all shy, I'm also not "up in yo face". Sorta post-hipster/preppy these days. I the the ocean, road trips,  levi's,  good food, fun experiences...ehh.. This is stupid. 
<br>

<br>
I'm looking for a cute 20 something chickee, somewhat inspiring I suppose. Don't worry, you wouldn't know if you were inspiring. Inspiration doesn't actually come from the muse, it's <i>because</i> of the muse. 
<br>

<br>Lets go out and have fun in the city? I know some fun places around davisadero! <br>

<br>
Anyways, can you post a little note about not being a bot? Seems like it's all Spam here?

I am looking for someone sweet who may need a bit of assistance to make ends meet. Perhaps you're a student who needs to pay for books or tuition? Or a mother who is a bit behind and needs a hand? <br>

I'm NOT looking to "hook up" tonight.

Lets be honest, dating sucks! You know it.....I know it, but what choice do we have. <br>
<br>
How does one find the time, patience and confidence to date a virtual stranger, let alone fall in love. The Answer is.....You don't, that crap happens only in the mind con artist's...er...I mean professional matchmakers. Over time, you have to develop a strong sense of self and work on staying positive, during one of those long dating droughts....yea, you know exactly the ones I'm talking about. That way, you don't worry about things like "why am I still single", "will I find true love" or "I wonder if any of my Facebook friends are free this weekend". <br>
<br>
We both know what brought you here today. Despite all the complaints you've personally have with men.....here you are.....reading my personal ad. I bet you've grown tired of the game, tried to meet the right person, but for one reason or another, things always ended up being a disappointment. Now you figure, what the hell, it's time to try again. I can only imagine how unsure you're feeling, acting on pure impulse. Any form of online dating has it's challenges, so make sure this is something you really would like to try. I believe we should never settle, but at the same time should expand our horizon in attraction. Like it or not, it takes time to find the right person. <br>
<br>
I know what you're thinking, it's not often a woman like yourself meets a man who doesn't seem to be clingy, desperate or lonely. I would pinch you to let you know you weren't dreaming, but that act alone might get me into trouble. <br>
<br>
For the record.....Yes, I'm a dude.....No, I'm not that arrogant......Yes, I'm pretty intuitive and.....No, I'm not too good to be true.<br>
<br>
Here are a few insights just to put your mind at ease:<br>
<br>
1) If you take me shopping, I'll hold packages, but refuse to hold your purse.<br>
2) I'm pretty lazy about throwing out the trash or using coasters.<br>
3) I will bolt if I hear the words, "the girls are coming over" or "honey we need to talk".<br>
<br>
I'll let you in on a secret, guys are just as screwed up & insecure about dating as women. I know it may not seem like it, but it's true. Take an average looking dude, living at home with mom, works in a dead in job and drives a beat up car, pour a few beers into him, he'll be acting like Brad Pitt looking for his Angelina Jolie. The idea of being someones project or changing for another is just not realistic. I think you would agree, we all would like a partner who likes us for who we are and not who we could be. If you recently met someone who implied otherwise.....news flash!.....he was lying and just wanted to get laid. For the record, I'm looking to date one woman who won't cause a disruption in my life, will be a dependable friend and likes to make out for hours on end. Shocking...I know, but it's the truth. Believe it or not, I won't be making any promises, waste your time or act in an inappropriate manner. <br>
<br>
Why? Well in a word.....I'm not a jackass! <br>
<br>
I'm a firm believer that women are the ones in control when it comes to dating. No, I don't mean as in S&M, but in the realization that ultimately it's the woman who says "Yes" to what you do together. So it falls to every man to present his case as best they can. It's how women decide if a guy is worth the pleasure of their company. Hell....right now you're trying to figure out if my approach is genuine or more BS. Sooner or later you'll get that, "why do I even bother" frame of mind. So i don't take it personal when you express yourself, nor do I worry about proving anything to you. If you decide to date me, it will come about after spending time together and not through several witty emails. All I can do is be honest, tell you who I am and hope for the best. Besides, I've way too much respect for women to cause you any grief. I'm sure you've had your fair share of jerks, cheaters and the creepy ones you caught wearing your clothes!<br>
<br>
By this point, you're probably curious as to what I look like. Usually I give details about myself, hoping the right woman will like what they read. In my experience it's a waste of time right now and tends to set up false expectations. Until we actually meet in person, how sure of the attraction can you be. We all want someone who gets our motor running, but in all honesty, it's not what you don't have....but how you use what you do. Anyway, if you're the type of woman who selects a man based on a brief description or a few pictures, then you're a bit too shallow for me. I consider myself a handsome guy (even cute on a good day), with a few things going on.However, I know deep down that I may be a "hottie" to one woman and a "nottie" to another. Looking for perfection is a nice fantasy, finding a compatible partner is the reality. The way I figure things, if I meet a smart woman who I connect with, then I'll tell her anything she wants to know. Until then, it's best to leave a bit of mystery.<br>
<br>
If that didn't do it for you then just know this:<br>
<br>
1) I've never run out of breath when running for the bus.<br>
2) I'm tall enough to ride roller coasters at amusement parks.<br>
3) I still young enough that I don't need ensure or wear diapers.<br>
4) I don't look like I belong in a police lineup.<br>
5) I've never been mistaken for a woman.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I believe in using creativity and sense of humor to charm a woman. I find it's a sure way to get a woman to smile, after that then it's just a matter of not screwing things up. I'm not material driven beyond my love of books and hopefully the woman I select is similarly inclined. I always speak my mind and would expect the same from my partner. I'm a natural servant, I enjoy doing for others. This doesn't mean that I'm submissive, nor am I looking for a mother. It just mans I know what it means to be a true friend. I pride myself on being educated, but at the same time I don't go around thinking I'm smarter then anyone else. Education comes from more than just taking standardized tests or attending an Ivy League College. I believe that our experiences are what teaches us to survive this thing we call life. I can be a whirlwind of energy with the right person, so no couch potato's here. Though I have my own tastes, I'll try almost anything once. <br>
<br>
I like genuine, independent, strong, confident, intelligent and sensual women. I've always been more comfortable and attracted to a lady who has a good idea of who she is, rather than someone still looking for answers. I love being around positive people and having a sense of humor is a big plus. Someone who can share not just their body, but their mind and soul. As far as physical traits I'm pretty open when it comes to race, age, body type or planet of origin. All I care about is you being comfortable with yourself, everything else is cool. Btw, I do appreciate it when a woman in heels. It not some secret kink or craving. I'm thoughful enough to acknowledge how much effort you all  put into looking your best. I've been pretty good about noticing my dates attire and complementing on it. So you don't have to worry, I'll always be letting you know just how good you look (with or without the heels). I like that pamper that special woman in my life whenever I can.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I wrote too much, but I like to be detailed and didn't want to miss anything. I figure with so much competition, writing the standard 2 sentence email wasn't going to cut it. If you respond, please let me know you actually read my ad by answering this one question: Why did you answer my ad? If I don't see your answer I take it that you're not really interested or someone sending spam. <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

Education comes from more than just taking standardized tests or attending an Ivy League College. I believe that our experiences are what teaches us to survive this thing we call life. I can be a whirlwind of energy with the right person, so no couch potato's here. Though I have my own tastes, I'll try almost anything once. <br>
<br>
I like genuine, independent, strong, confident, intelligent and sensual women. I've always been more comfortable and attracted to a lady who has a good idea of who she is, rather than someone still looking for answers. I love being around positive people and having a sense of humor is a big plus. Someone who can share not just their body, but their mind and soul. As far as physical traits I'm pretty open when it comes to race, age, body type or planet of origin. All I care about is you being comfortable with yourself, everything else is cool. Btw, I do appreciate it when a woman in heels. It not some secret kink or craving. I'm thoughful enough to acknowledge how much effort you all  put into looking your best. I've been pretty good about noticing my dates attire and complementing on it. So you don't have to worry, I'll always be letting you know just how good you look (with or without the heels). I like that pamper that special woman in my life whenever I can.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I wrote too much, but I like to be detailed and didn't want to miss anything. I figure with so much competition, writing the standard 2 sentence email wasn't going to cut it. If you respond, please let me know you actually read my ad by answering this one question: Why did you answer my ad? If I don't see your answer I take it that you're not really interested or someone sending spam. <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

Whatever lies in the deepest, darkest, innermost recesses of your mind Craigslist is where we bring our deepest desires, in the hope of finding someone who shares them. Kinky sex, extramarital affairs, lighthearted dates, particular acts we've never explored, our needs for connection of all sorts. <br>
<br>
I have been able to find connections in this way; perhaps you have, too. But I have a deep fear that I will never find that one person who shares my edge, who rides that same line between kinkiness and respect, between sex and love, between comfort and challenge, having a alternative, kinky relationship alongside the well-adjusted cultured, sophisticated relationship. The woman who will understand and embrace me, and all my peculiarities, and allow me to do the same of her's. I'm afraid that time is running out, and that I won't have the patience or physical stamina to wait much longer. <br>
<br>
Fit and attractive, smart and strong, open and bold, sexually experienced and sure, complicated and intense, I'm looking for a single woman who can handle all that and more. I guess I'm looking for something real, but prefer to check sexual chemistry first. I hope I'm asking in the right place. <br>

Please Be Woman Over Age 53.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
Low levels of estrogen and muscle elasticity cause the vaginal walls in many women over a certain age, specially post-menopausal, to become thinner and less lubricated, which leads to some pain or discomfort during love making.  Low testosterones are responsible for low libido.  This tends to slow their Love life and leads them to either avoid personal relationships or become hesitant to form a new one! Few men are loving, knowledgeable and patient enough to understand or realize that.  <br>
<br>
Love-making is a special pleasure and the expression of strong emotions with that 'special person'.  I look forward to finding that 'special woman'! <br>
<br>
Intimacy (cuddling, gentle kissing, caressing...) provides a lot of physical pleasure and emotional satisfaction.  It is always pleasurable, painless and safest at our age.  Kissing increases the secretion of   oxytocin, which triggers a higher appetite for intimacy and love-making.<br>
<br>
The young is more sexual but less experienced and less intimate. The older is more mature, more experienced, less sexual but more intimate.  I'm glad I belong to the latter group.  Do you? <br>
<br>
I am a Single DWM, 61/Mild-mannered gentleman, Fit & Healthy, romantic, with good sense of humor & healthy libido, physically & mentally active, financially & emotionally secure.<br>
<br>
If you, partially or fully, agree with above, and would like to chat further, plz drop a line.  Be kind, and I'll kindly communicate. Your photo is appreciated<br>
<br>
Foods that increase libido are Walnuts, Mango, Dark Chocolate (65% Cocoa Min), Asparagus, Oysters, Oatmeal, Cranberries, Celery... to name a few. <br>
<br>
Love, Chocolate and Peace.  <br>

Hey there girls, spambots, scammers and trolls of CL!<br>
<br>
You might like to get to know me if:<br>
You like music (I am a hardcore music nerd), philosophy, board games, indi flicks, law, good discussions, pets, sunsets, backpacking, cuddling, politics and the like<br>
<br>
I am looking for a down to earth chill girl to enjoy some good herb with, drink or whatever gets you lifted. Golden Gate park is ideal, but the cuddle weather outside will probably guide us inside :)<br>
<br>
We can smoke, flirt and see what happens :)<br>
<br>
I am a musician who owns his own business and likes to enjoy his free time. I am 5'11, have green eyes and brown hair, a little facial hair and I am close to being HWP. I also have little to no hangups and really just want to spend some time with someone new :)<br>
<br>
If you would like to know anything more just ask :)<br>
<br>
Please send me some pics of yourself and include your favorite day of the week in the title of the email. I will gladly return the favor :)<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting!<br>
<br>
P.s. I included a picture of my junk.... come on it's CL... I had to be a pervert

Thanks for taking the time to read my post... Well, here I go again. I tried to be as up front and as honest as I possibly can. However, I see that way is appreciated. The proof is all the faux responses sent to me. Don't get me wrong; there were a few real responses that were interesting but didn't quite pan out. So, here I go again! Iam single - that means I've NEVER been married! African Black Guy, BHM (...big, handsome male; 6ft. tall,230lb), immaculately clean, D/D free, a non-smoker (...a cigar now and again that's all!) and a social drinker. I live in Oakland, California and work in San francisco, as a property manager. Iam looking for a single BBW (...race open; between 25-52) who would appreciate a good man. Someone who is a lot like myself a person that loves to laugh, who is down-to-earth, stress free, open-minded and independent. Someone that wants something real, for a change. Basically a monogamous, voluptuous nymphomaniac who is big & beautiful, like myself - lol! Most of all, she has to be comfortable with herself. I've always loved, admired and respected women of size, so I would definitely appreciate her if she enters my life. If Iam talking about you, then be real! Take a chance and respond with a current photo. Let see what develops. I look forward to hearing from you
