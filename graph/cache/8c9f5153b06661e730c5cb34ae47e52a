Stages and Steps <br>
<br>
STAGE ONE: REMEMBERING <br>
1. I am in a breakthrough crisis, having gained some sense of my abuse. <br>
2. I have determined that I was physically, sexually or emotionally abused as a child. <br>
3. I have made a commitment to recovery from my childhood abuse. <br>
4. I shall re-experience each set of memories as they surface in my mind. <br>
5. I accept that I was powerless over my abusers' actions, which holds THEM responsible. <br>
6. I can respect my shame and anger as a consequence of my abuse, but shall try not to turn it against myself or others. <br>
7. I can sense my inner child whose efforts to survive now can be appreciated. <br>
STAGE TWO: MOURNING <br>
8. I have made an inventory of the problem areas in my adult life. <br>
9. I have identified the parts of myself connected to self-sabotage. <br>
10.I can control my anger and find healthy outlets for my aggression. <br>
11.I can identify faulty beliefs and distorted perceptions in myself and others. <br>
12.I am facing my shame and developing self-compassion. <br>
13.I accept that I have the right to be who I want to be and live the way I want to live. <br>
14.I am able to grieve my childhood and mourn the loss of those who failed me. <br>
STAGE THREE: HEALING <br>
15.I am entitled to take the initiative to share in life's riches. <br>
16.I am strengthening the healthy parts of myself, adding to my self-esteem. <br>
17.I can make necessary changes in my behavior and relationships at home and work. <br>
18.I have resolved the abuse with my offenders to the extent that is acceptable to me. <br>
19.I hold my own meaning about the abuse that releases me from the legacy of the past. <br>
20.I see myself as a thriver in all aspects of life - love, work, parenting, and play. <br>

Hello,<br>
<br>
I'd like to start a group for people working on novels.  The idea would be to bring a page of prose you want looked at, trade, edit, and then give each other feedback.  I've been in writers' groups before and this has worked out well.  Probably meet at a bar or cafe in San Francisco.  Let me know if you're interested.<br>

Love baseball? We are a baseball group looking for baseball enthusiasts to be part of our club. There is no cost to join. People of all skill levels welcome.<br>

We play Saturdays at Evergreen High School at 10:30 a.m. We will meet at the softball field closest to the baseball field. Bring whatever baseball equipment you can (bats, helmets, gloves, balls). We are in need of catchers, catcher's gear, bats, and helmets.<br>

We play mostly scrimmages, but we will play other teams often too.<br>
<br>
Show up if you are interested, but try to respond via e-mail if you are coming so we can get a count.<br>

Hope to see you out there!

Looking to play some baseball? <br>
<br>
We are starting a competitive baseball team in San Jose and are looking for players to be part of our group. <br>
<br>
If you have played baseball in the past and want to play again, are currently playing baseball and just want more practice, or are someone whose love of the game exceeds his/her current skill level, then feel free to come out.<br>
<br>
There is no cost to join. Anyone can come out to play.<br>
<br>
We need a catcher for tomorrow's game. Let me know ASAP if you can make it and if you're a catcher.<br>
Please bring a glove, baseball, and a bat if you have one. If you don't have a bat or balls, come out anyway as there should be some available. If anyone has catcher's gear, let me know.<br>
<br>
We play Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. at JD Morgan Park in Campbell.<br>
<br>
Do not feel at all uneasy about coming out if you are not good at baseball just yet. We will do our best to work with you so you can learn the fundamental skills of baseball. If you come and show effort to get better, you will play. However, we are in need of experienced or semi-experienced players for our game in two Saturdays. If you fit that bill, you are especially welcome.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in playing, respond to this posting via e-mail. Also, let us know about your baseball experience.

You are invited to join an ongoing character analytic psychotherapy group for those seeking character restructuring at deep levels.  This is a fairly intense, personally-demanding psychotherapy process.  The group meets for two hours every other Monday evening in San Francisco.  Current members of the group are or have been in individual psychotherapy, allowing for a high level of consciousness and feedback.  New members must also be in individual psychotherapy with Dr Schierholz.<br>
<br>
The group encourages individual introspection, self-awareness, self-activation, and change through deep, spontaneous, and authentic interaction among members.  Honesty and deep intimacy within the group provide the support and safety to experiment with your definition of self in bold and profound ways that insist on change.  Members share honest, direct feedback with others as well as communicate their own personal experiences and feelings.<br>
<br>
Among other things this group may help you:<br>
* Communicate in a more congruent fashion	<br>
* Build more open, trusting relationships<br>
* Be more fully yourself and express more parts of yourself<br>
* Be in touch with your emotions and express them in an appropriate way<br>
* Raise and resolve difficult interpersonal issues within the group and elsewhere<br>
<br>
This group is led by Neil Schierholz PsyD.  Please call him directly at the number below for further information, to discuss the appropriateness of this group for you, and to schedule an initial diagnostic consultation.<br>

Richard A Blasband MD G5239, Supervisor<br>

Support group for people with pet parrots. All types from parrotlets to Macaws. Especially for new owner/parents. Parrots are supposed to have the emotional maturity of a two-year old. Share what you have learned about living with a parrot, training your parrot, feeding and interacting with your parrot.<br>
<br>
People who are considering adopting a parrot are also welcome. We are not experts, just newbies to experienced, but we invite experts from bird vets, to bird trainers, to experienced Mickaboo members (Mickaboo is the primary bird rescue organization in the the northern California area and is made up completely of volunteers who rescue, foster and/or adopt parrots and other birds.)<br>
<br>
The group meets on the first Monday of each month at 7:30pm just until 9:00pm. There is no charge.<br>
<br>
Location in San Rafael. Call David, the group facilitator, at 415-479-3945 for more information including location.

CHANGE...is inevitable. You might be completing something--a job, a relationship, or an educational program. Or you could be on a precipice, considering a new direction altogether. A big transition may already be in motion, instigated by you or some outside force, and the ground under your feet is shifting. This could engender a plethora of feelings, ranging from expectant excitement to gripped terror. Or you may know that you need to make changes but you feel stuck, confused or without the appropriate resources. Big life questions are staring you in the face with no easy solutions. <br>
<br>
CHOICE... Moving out of the familiar, perhaps the habitual, we enter the great unknown. At times we don't even sense what colors are available on our personal life palette. We've been painting with earth tones so long that a splash of blue or wide swashes of neon orange feel edgy and uncomfortable. How do we entertain greater options, take healthy risks and paint a larger, more passionate life? Bringing awareness to our interactions opens the pathway to develop new and healthier choices. <br>
<br>
CONNECTION...is an important avenue that offers camaraderie and understanding. Companions support what is essential and challenge us when necessary. We are accompanied and assisted in the hard work of change. We see ourselves reflected when we witness their journeys, appreciate each other's unique attributes and celebrate our inevitable successes. Together we practice new skills and take greater risks. As a result we break open the constraints that may have limited our lives as we embrace new and exciting opportunities. <br>
<br>
CONTINUITY...builds safety. It provides the ground from which to launch into new endeavors, new relationships, new aspects of ourselves. A small, ongoing group cultivates intimacy, grows respect, offers wise council and thereby holds us accountable to connection, choice and inevitable change. Participation will change you. Become part of a facilitated group of dedicated individuals committed to LIFE in living color! <br>

Are you Latino and gay, bi, questioning, or queer? Are you a second, third, or fourth generation Latino? Do you feel like an outsider in the Latino community because you do not speak Spanish? Do you have questions about how to enjoy sex and keep your risk for HIV/STDs low? Have you recently been told you're HIV-positive? <br>
<br>
I am a Health Educator at the new Latino Prevention Center which offers support programs for Spanish and English-speaking Latinos. In addition to all of our groups in Spanish, we are forming a group for Latinos that speak English. The group setting is non-judgmental, supportive and friendly. You will have a chance to meet other gay, bi, queer, and questioning Latinos that speak English. In the group we will explore topics like passing as another race, how to negotitate Latino identities if we do not speak Spanish, and we will discuss any other topics that interest you. Our team and other group members will listen to you talk about concerns, things in your life that are going well, and things you'd like to work on. <br>
<br>
We have a wide selection of free condoms and lube and dinner is provided every group.<br>
<br>

I use Cannabis but I don't drink or do any kind of drugs. Are you in the same situation.<br>
"Where are our meetings"? There is a twelve step program for everything one can think of....last I heard there where over 150 twelve step meetings.<br>
<br>
The "Any A" meeting at Harbin works for everyone. You are there for any issue you have, and so are the rest of the people. No judgements, just a place where anyone can go and feel safe and talk about what they need too. It is the same format as "AA". There could be 20 people at the meeting and everyone could be there for a different reason.<br>
<br>
Please, no negative e-mails or speeches. If your not interested or don't agree just leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Are there any other people who would be interested?<br>

Mondays 7:30 -- 9:00 PM<br>
<br>
The Heart of Recovery is a meditation  meeting for anyone recovering from anything.   There's meditation  with  a bit of guidance  (not that you have to do it that way), a reading, and discussion in a 12-step format.  <br>
<br>
"Everyone loves the idea of living in the moment," said one teacher, "just not this moment."<br>
<br>
Meditation isn't about "blissing out," but dealing with the way our minds are--right here, right now.  The trick is being precise and gentle and actually doing it--a big help regardless of what you believe in or don't.<br>

I would like to participate in a Tarot study group. The idea is to explore the various meanings of the Tarot cards and maybe practice doing readings with each other.<br>
<br>
If you have one, I'd like to join.<br>
<br>
If you'd like one, I'd like to create one.<br>
<br>
We can probably find a coffee shop to meet or trade off meeting at people's homes.<br>

I am new to Santa Rosa and want to meet new people. So, I figured the best way to do this is to start a meetup group for events such as dinner, movies, bowling, Pool, Theatre and just an overall myriad of activities to create cultural awareness and preservation. Do you enjoy getting out, grabbing ahold of life and trying new things? I would like to meet a people who would be interested in starting a meetup group with the purpose of enjoying as much as life as possible. No need to spend lots of money everytime you do something. With a group, we can get better rates. Nature is a huge part of my life, So I would like to incorporate people who have a vast knowledge or desire to learn about, local nature. I'm thinking of getting out tonight (Friday) and meeting new peeps. If you want to join and meet new people and/or if you know people who would want to come and meet others, lets fifure out a nice fun Friday Night outing!<br>
<br>
I am and hope to find people who are diverse and willing to accept others from all walks of life. There is so much to learn from each other and our own personal experiences.<br>
<br>
Hope to hear back from some of you soon. I will give my number upon first email.<br>

Hi! I am a 30 year old first time mom of a 21 month old handsome boy. I am looking for working moms that have similar aged children to join together and have a small (5 kids or so) playgroup. My hope is that we can get together on weekends and have our kids play together, as well as take small day trips to the aquarium, zoo, parks, and perhaps a larger annual trip to Disneyland or something! I want my son to make friends outside of daycare so if you are interested, let me know!<br>
<br>
About us: We are interracial, black and korean. My son is extremely friendly and loves other people but is sort of shy at first. He is not the agressive type. We live in Martinez but this playgroup is open to all areas in the East Bay and Contra Costa County.<br>
<br>
Email me if you are interested! :) Once I get some responses we can start planning something fun! I am hoping to start the group meetings around the beginning of the new year so we have time to plan for birthdays and a years worth of fun times!

I've been offering a weekly ongoing workshop for writers of long and short fiction, memoirs, essays, plays and screenplays. (Though the group is chiefly fiction writers, we're open to all writers of creative prose.) The group is limited to 6 writers and meets on Wednesday afternoons in a lovely yellow house near downtown San Rafael, close to the Golden Gate Transit bus hub. Current members include published writers as well as talented beginners: everyone learns from everyone else.<br>
<br>
I bring 25 years of teaching creative writing at the college level (College of Marin, San Francisco State, and as Visiting Writer at many colleges and universities). My books (see Amazon) have brought such honors as the Lannan Foundation Literary Award, the American Book Award, the California Book Award from the Commonwealth Club, and the Northern California Book Award from the Bay Area Book Reviewers Association. I'm also a former Wallace Stegner Fellow in Creative Writing at Stanford, where I studied with Grace Paley and Denise Levertov.

<br>
I'm looking for writers who are committed to learning and helping each other and getting to the next level. (Which is not to say we don't have some fun along the way.) Again, it doesn't matter if you're just starting out, have been on the path awhile, or off the path awhile. William Kennedy once said, "You can't go around saying you're a writer if no one will take you seriously." In this class you'll be taken seriously.<br>

Class starts off with  hour of warm-up and strength-training exercises, along with rolling and falling practice. Then we do  hour learning and perfecting techniques. The last  hour of class is used for mat (grappling) and standing (throwing) randori. Class is fun but serious and focused.<br>
<br>
All students will need a judo gi (uniform) after the first class, and students will be encouraged to join the United States Judo Federation, which carries martial arts health insurance.

 Master H.L. Schauer founded the Shaolin Wudang Association to teach practical martial arts to dedicated and mindful people in the local community. Training at the school includes traditional Kung Fu (Northern Shaolin, Hung Gar and Wing Chun), Daoist arts (Tai Chi, Ba Gua and Xing Yi), practical self defense techniques like grappling, defense against weapons, and many other skills synthesized from the best martial arts sources around the world. Members of the school gain strength and confidence with an emphasis on mental, physical and spiritual balance  as well as a strong social ethic of awareness, compassion and fairness. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
   The lessons serve as a path toward real personal development in terms of physical ability, mental awareness and spiritual growth. The learning environment is welcoming to all types of people, young and old, fast or slow, and can provide a much needed network of honest hardworking people with integrity and values that support eachother.  Combine the best exercise in the world, realistic self defense technique and solid philosophical and ethical foundations and you have the Shaolin Wudang Association. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rates are very reasonable considering the level of training, and are determined on a sliding scale based on income. Come visit a class(see website for schedule)  or contact Master Schauer at (415) 564-9282 and email: swakungfu@gmail.com.<br>

Reasons in favor of starting one:<br>
<br>
-It's hard to get a solid critique out of your friends, even though they're writers or into literature or into poetry or into zines. Because they're busy. Or not invested in other people's work. Or whatever.  <br>
-Feedback really helps. <br>
-We could develop our work in a space where its queerness wouldn't make it marginal or exotic.<br>
-We could turn each other on to the queer poetry and lit we haven't found/read yet<br>
-Most of the American and European literary canon is heterosexist, white and male. This is alienating. A safe space, where we can define our literary values as queers, would be a great thing for developing our voices as writers. <br>

Sifu Jacob Tomson<br>
Wing Chun Kung Fu - Private Lessons Instructor     <br>
Wing Chun is a truly amazing and beautiful kung fu style. It is one of the most practical martial art systems you can study. Wing Chun is a perfect art for the uncertainties of actual self-defense. The system relies on biomechanics, not brute force. Wing Chun is a scientific yet theoretically based martial arts form. A Wing Chun practitioner is agile yet powerful. It is based on the concepts and principles of simplicity, economy of movement, and economy of energy. This art is a true internal and external system designed so you can learn the system in a few short years. It is a science in motion that is simple and yet explosive.<br>
     Hello, I am Sifu Jacob Tomson, and I teach Wing Chun Kung Fu to teenagers and to adults. I teach privately to students in the comfort of their own homes. Private or small group lessons allow me to assess each student's skills better. The result is a more accurate and effective lesson plan.<br>
<br>
     If you have some relatives or friends that can meet at a home for lessons, I can offer group discounts. <br>
Private and small group lessons offer many benefits. It can provide flexible training days and time to the busy student and working professionals. Because I don't have to rent and pay for space, I pass the tuition savings to you.<br>
<br>
     I also volunteer three mornings a week on Saturday (9am- 10am), Sunday, and Monday at Fremont's Lake Elizabeth Park, teaching basic Wing Chun Kung Fu for free from 8am - 9am. We meet outdoors just a few yards from the Fremont Senior Hall. Feel free to come by the park and join us.  <br>

Group Purpose<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our group purpose is multi-fold. The main reason we meet is for emotional support, but self-help, education, and political advocacy go hand-in-hand. Our focus will be on what we CAN do to improve our health and functionality. Our medical treatment options may be limited, but what we can do about it is NOT. We do this in the following ways:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 by supporting each other, and sharing our experiences, strength, and hope<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 by sharing information about doctors, health care providers, and other resources  by using political advocacy to increase research into treatments, and raise awareness about FM<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 and by following the CFIDS and FM Self-Help program created by Bruce Campbell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CFIDS and FM Self-Help Program<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The meeting adopts part of it's format from the CFIDS/FM Self-Help Support Group format, based in cognitive behavioral therapy and created by Bruce Campbell Ph.D. Here is Campbell's description of the program:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FM changes every part of our lives: how much we can do, our ability to work, our moods, our relationships, our finances, our hopes and dreams, and our sense of who we are. Adding to the challenge is the fact that it is a chronic illness, with no cure or standard medical treatment. Living with this illness can often feel overwhelming and discouraging."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The CFIDS & FM Self-Help program was developed as a response. The program is based on belief in the value of self-help: we can learn how to feel better and increase our chances for recovery by taking responsibility for the parts of our illness over which we have control. It is also based on belief in the power of groups: we can help ourselves and one another by<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
meeting to discuss our experience, and share hope and support with one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We believe there is much we can do to limit the effects of symptoms, to bring predictability, and to improve quality of life. Strategies include:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- finding and accepting the limits imposed by the illness<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- pacing ourselves through balancing activity and rest<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- reducing the stresses in our lives<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- using medications<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- nurturing ourselves through positive and pleasurable experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- sustaining ourselves through supportive relationships<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- maintaining a positive outlook ***<br>

Meeting Format<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the first part of the group we have workshops. Each group member will have an allotted amount of time, about 4 to 9 minutes depending upon how many people are present. Each person has a choice of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. sharing without feedback - The person will share without interruptions or comments for the entire allotted time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. sharing and receiving feedback - The sharing portion is, again, without interruptions or comments. You can also ask the group any questions you may have.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. requesting information or advice - A group member can use his/her entire allotted time asking for and receiving information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Whatever you decide, remember that you must be done within the allotted time - this includes time for feedback. The point is to give each person the opportunity to have the entire group help him/her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't interrupt anyone who is sharing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't criticize or offer advice, unless the person specifically asks for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't use another person's share time to ask them questions. Please wait for your turn. Their time is to be used for their benefit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the second part of the meeting we discuss that month's topic.<br>

Group Purpose<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our group purpose is multi-fold. The main reason we meet is for emotional support, but self-help, education, and political advocacy go hand-in-hand. Our focus will be on what we CAN do to improve our health and functionality. Our medical treatment options may be limited, but what we can do about it is NOT. We do this in the following ways:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 by supporting each other, and sharing our experiences, strength, and hope<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 by sharing information about doctors, health care providers, and other resources  by using political advocacy to increase research into treatments, and raise awareness about FM<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 and by following the CFIDS and FM Self-Help program created by Bruce Campbell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CFIDS and FM Self-Help Program<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The meeting adopts part of it's format from the CFIDS/FM Self-Help Support Group format, based in cognitive behavioral therapy and created by Bruce Campbell Ph.D. Here is Campbell's description of the program:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FM changes every part of our lives: how much we can do, our ability to work, our moods, our relationships, our finances, our hopes and dreams, and our sense of who we are. Adding to the challenge is the fact that it is a chronic illness, with no cure or standard medical treatment. Living with this illness can often feel overwhelming and discouraging."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The CFIDS & FM Self-Help program was developed as a response. The program is based on belief in the value of self-help: we can learn how to feel better and increase our chances for recovery by taking responsibility for the parts of our illness over which we have control. It is also based on belief in the power of groups: we can help ourselves and one another by<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
meeting to discuss our experience, and share hope and support with one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We believe there is much we can do to limit the effects of symptoms, to bring predictability, and to improve quality of life. Strategies include:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- finding and accepting the limits imposed by the illness<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- pacing ourselves through balancing activity and rest<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- reducing the stresses in our lives<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- using medications<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- nurturing ourselves through positive and pleasurable experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- sustaining ourselves through supportive relationships<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- maintaining a positive outlook ***<br>

Meeting Format<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the first part of the group we have workshops. Each group member will have an allotted amount of time, about 4 to 9 minutes depending upon how many people are present. Each person has a choice of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. sharing without feedback - The person will share without interruptions or comments for the entire allotted time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. sharing and receiving feedback - The sharing portion is, again, without interruptions or comments. You can also ask the group any questions you may have.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. requesting information or advice - A group member can use his/her entire allotted time asking for and receiving information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Whatever you decide, remember that you must be done within the allotted time - this includes time for feedback. The point is to give each person the opportunity to have the entire group help him/her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't interrupt anyone who is sharing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't criticize or offer advice, unless the person specifically asks for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't use another person's share time to ask them questions. Please wait for your turn. Their time is to be used for their benefit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the second part of the meeting we discuss that month's topic.<br>

There is nothing better than people coming together for the sheer joy of...well, having fun! Fun is what soccer is all about. Yes, it's competitive and it's engaging! But, above all, its simply fun! That is why I would like to invite people like you, who share my love of the game, to a game of pick-up soccer, to be held EVERY SUNDAY at the fields in Hagemann Park at 10am (corner of Turnstone Drive & Daisyfield Drive in Livermore). The group is entirely co-ed, and all skill levels are invited. Once we have more players than one field can handle, we can split the teams up into two skill levels. Hagemann Park can easily accommodate a split because there two soccer fields side by side. For the time being it's all about having fun, getting some good exercise, and making some good friends. I invite you to come join us.<br>
<br>
Check out the group site on Meetup. I regularly update this site to let everyone know about upcoming games.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you at our next game.<br>

I am interested in starting a french conversation group.<br>
<br>
my idea would be to get together once a week somewhere on the peninsula at a coffee shop and just speak french (or franglais when we need to improvise :))<br>
I just graduated and finished taking the french series in college and now want to practice to keep up! I would classify myself as an intermediate speaker. I can hold a conversation and it may not be perfect, but would like people who can converse relatively fluently so we can help each other. Anyway if you are interested email me and we can put something together! Hoping this will be a no-pressure, fun way to practice french and meet some cool new people.<br>
<br>
merci!

Motherhood has a dark side that rarely gets talked about in casual conversation. Sometimes women need a safe place to explore feelings that at times can feel completely overwhelming. We all need time to get away and think about our own needs. Time for self care. Are you looking for a safe place where you can talk about these issues and give and receive support? Time away, to think about your needs and decompress. <br>
<br>
Learn how you are affected by the way you were parented; how to respond instead of react when you get triggered; how to disengage from power struggles. Parenting can be stressful whether our kids are infants, teens, or anywhere in between. We are all plagued with self-doubt as to whether we are good enough. Well, here's the good news. If you are asking the question, you probably are. We meet Friday mornings in San Rafael. Come join us.

Hi There<br>
<br>
Is anyone interested in meeting up on a monthly basis for a scrapbooking crop? <br>
<br>
I am getting back into scraping after a LONG absence and looking to start a group in Petaluma. Ideally, we'd meet somewhere like the library community room, at Round Table upstairs, a church, etc. somewhere with some space that does not require a fee. We'd bring our own stuff and scrap for a few hours. <br>
<br>
My schedule is fairly flexible so daytime during school hours work too or some evening. <br>
<br>
If you are interested in meeting up, sharing ideas, stories,  and inspiration contact me.<br>
<br>
All interested parties welcome.<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from you soon.

Hello World!<br>
<br>
I am a chubby girl and I would like to meet fat positive girls.  I would like to have a support network with women who share my stories.  I want to talk about fashion, nail polish, fat phobia, food, all kinds of things.  I am trying to create a group of women who would like to meet semi regularly to just hang out in a safe space talking story and eating snacks.  I am from NYC, 30y/o and I like real people who speak their minds, not speak your mind like NENE on Real Housewives..lol. If you are fat, skinny, in the middle or whatever...pls respond to this. If you just moved here and want more friends...pls respond to this.  If your friends are flaky and you want to reevaluate your relationship with them...pls respond to this.  <br>
<br>
Looking forward to creating a new group of pals to chillax with!<br>
<br>
Spirit leeches and fakers pls don't respond!<br>
<br>
If you are a fat hater, save your breath!

Success Team or Mastermind "graduates" sought.  What do I mean by "graduates"?<br>
<br>
<br>
...you are a "graduate" if you write to do lists, distribute them(not afraid to show them to a private group), ask for feedback(not afraid to ask  a private group), want regular (weekly?)meetings(virtual?)...<br>
<br>
What do I mean by "Sher without fluff"?<br>
<br>
There will probably be "minimal hand holding" to try to figure out what you want if you know what you want but you refuse to say.<br>
<br>
<br>
....you must be able to show up at a regular (weekly?)meeting(virtual?) and tell everyone: "I failed to do what I said I would."<br>
<br>
(we all fall short but few can admit it)<br>
<br>
each member will have equal time (so each member's turn will have equal time)...(barter style)support<br>
<br>
e.g. I want my support person to do something(to be specified... e.g. read a script....or e.g. listen to how my day went..or e.g. cause my mirror neurons to behave like I want them to.. or?).<br>
<br>
For more information please email the above temporary anonymous craigslist email address.<br>
<br>
Thank you!  ...and success to you!<br>

Success Team or Mastermind "graduates" sought.  What do I mean by "graduates"?<br>
<br>
<br>
...you are a "graduate" if you write to do lists, distribute them(not afraid to show them to a private group), ask for feedback(not afraid to ask  a private group), want regular (weekly?)meetings(virtual?)...<br>
<br>
What do I mean by "Sher without fluff"?<br>
<br>
There will probably be "minimal hand holding" to try to figure out what you want if you know what you want but you refuse to say.<br>
<br>
<br>
....you must be able to show up at a regular (weekly?)meeting(virtual?) and tell everyone: "I failed to do what I said I would."<br>
<br>
(we all fall short but few can admit it)<br>
<br>
each member will have equal time (so each member's turn will have equal time)...(barter style)support<br>
<br>
e.g. I want my support person to do something(to be specified... e.g. read a script....or e.g. listen to how my day went..or e.g. cause my mirror neurons to behave like I want them to.. or?).<br>
<br>
For more information please email the above temporary anonymous craigslist email address.<br>
<br>
Thank you!  ...and success to you!<br>
:-)

Our ongoing support group exists to provide a safe, low-no cost place in Marin where people can get support as they navigate life after a relationship loss. We are all professional people (of a variety of ages) in some phase of divorce, from the initial shock through starting new, healthy relationships. Our meetings are casual and comfortable. We do everything possible to make a sometimes awkward, difficult, reluctant effort to join such a group, a warm and welcoming experience. This group has been supporting people through relationship loss since 1986. <br>
<br>
We are now in between our formal sessions (where a topic related to divorce recovery is presented). Our current meetings follow a relaxed, comfortable, conversational format; sharing is completely optional. We often reference the award-winning book on Divorce Recovery, "Rebuilding: When You're Relationship Ends" by Bruce Fisher and Robert Alberti. (Available for purchase). An optional $50 fee would cover cost of book and UNLIMITED attendance at all future meetings. No one is ever turned away due to lack of funds.<br>
 <br>
Doors open at 7:00 for check-in and conversation. Meeting begins at 7:30.<br>
<br>

Are you a writer with a project you just aren't getting to? Would it help to be with a group on a weekly basis, a group that has no leader or agenda other than  providing a space and time with fellow writers? Sometimes it helps to stay on course just being in the company of others. Perhaps we would share some snacks, perhaps a glass of wine, maybe read from our works, possible share feedback; or, alternately, just share the comradery of clicking keyboards.

An additional altar server is needed to serve the Traditional Catholic Latin Mass.  No experience or knowledge of Latin is necessary.  We will teach you what you need to know.<br>
<br>
For eighteen years St. John's Oratory has been making available to the San Francisco Bay Area the Traditional Catholic Latin Mass in St. John's Oratory at the historic Fishermen's & Seamen's Memorial Chapel at Fishermen's Wharf in San Francisco.  St. John's Oratory is the only location in the Bay Area that has preserved the Traditional Catholic Latin Mass (1950) and other Catholic rites before they were converted to a New Order, starting in the 1950s.<br>
<br>
For further information, you can view our web site at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.traditio.com/stjohn.htm">St. John the Apostle Oratory.</a>  If you are interested, you may contact the Oratory at ssja(at)traditio.com or (800) 528-4625.<br>

I read the entire Course this past year.  I am now on lesson 274 (Have not missed a day!) and would love to talk to someone who has read the Course and is doing or has done the lessons.  No one I know knows anything about this, and although it a "Self Study" course, it would be nice to meet people who are thinking similar thoughts to mine.

Anyone want to talk about 2012, channeling, galactic federation, spirituality, new age and such over cup of coffee? Drop us an email with a description of you and your interests. There was similar meetup dot com group to this one that recently closed down, I never got to the chance to go to it but I did talk to the owner. <br>
<br>
I'm 29, male, iranian, used to live in Santa Cruz, into meditation and progressive politics.  I've been watching 2012 unravel since way before anybody seemed to care. I got into it when I talk to this guy in Santa Cruz. He told me to go read Return of the Bird Tribes by Ken Carey and also the Third Millennium by Ken Carey. <br>
<br>
What Carey described in 1986 seems to be happening now.  Then again, my interpretation of events doesn't seem so groovy anymore. I don't know what to make of it. Come tell me what you think?<br>
<br>
I actually live in the east bay, so I'm down to have the meeting anywhere in the Bay Area or to change locations. The old group was in the south bay.  Just tell me what works best for you. I don't expect there to be a lot of people, judging by how small the meetup dot com group turned out. <br>

<p>When people asked the Buddha why and what he taught, he replied "I teach because 
you and all beings seek happiness and try to avoid suffering.  I teach <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Way-Things-Are-Approach-Buddhism/dp/1846940427/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224553956&amp;sr=8-2">the way things are</a>." </p>

<p>So what is Buddhism?  Buddha used the best description himself.  During the 1,500 years 
the teachings existed in India, they were called Dharma, and for the last 1000 years in Tibet 
the name was Cho.  Both mean "the way things are".  Understanding the way things are is 
the key to every happiness.</p>

<p>The <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.diamondway.org/sf">Diamond Way Buddhist Center San Francisco</a> is one of a worldwide network of 
Buddhist Centers founded by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lama-ole-nydahl.org">Lama Ole Nydahl</a>&nbsp;according to the wishes of the late 16th 
Gyalwa Karmapa.  They are now under the spiritual guidance of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.karmapa.com">17th Gyalwa 
Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje</a>, spiritual head of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.karma-kagyu.org">Karma Kagyu Lineage</a>, which is one

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.diamondway.org">Diamond Way (Vajrayana) Buddhism</a>.  The Diamond Way is the crown jewel of the 
Buddha's teachings; it employs methods of total identification with enlightenment for 
quickest results.  The teachings are presented in a relaxed, contemporary style that makes 
them readily accessible to Westerners who want to know the nature of their mind.</p>

I am interested in starting a sobriety group that would meet in a relaxed context and simply set goals around moving towards sobriety and abstaining from alcohol all together.<br>
<br>
I find with my own drinking the times I have worked along with others to take long sabbaticals from drinking has been the most successful times I've had for sobriety.<br>
<br>
I have gone to AA meeting, gone to smarter recovery and life ring meetings and enjoyed them all.<br>
Yet again, my sense is that creating a small group where the people involved  desire to set goals around alcohol use and we can support one another in reaching those goals would be a really interesting approach<br>
<br>
My thought was that perhaps we could meet at a coffee shop here in downtown Berkeley if that works for everyone involved. Once started we could be connected by email and could really work together as as a group to support one another.<br>
<br>
Not sure if there is anyone out there who will be interested in this but it's definitely worth communicating the idea and seeing what response comes in.<br>
<br>
Look forward to talking with you!

 Most men who have anger issues are good people under all kinds of high stress and wish that they could handle their emotions better. Anger is the tip of an iceberg of anxiety, stress, dysfunctional communication skills within high stress relationship challenges, or work situations. Anger is accompanied by feelings of isolation. loneliness and feelings of being shamed, guilt-tripped or scapegoated. Men have not had the benefit of the support and "training" that they hunger for. Being in a group with other men provides a safe, non-judgemental place to explore and learn new skills, and you'll learn to feel much better! . These are psychotherapy groups for men that meet weekly, cost on average 50 dollars a meeting, and involve an interview process to join. 3 month minimum commitment, and best results happen over time. These are not anger management "classes" nor are they connected to court-referred programs. <br>
