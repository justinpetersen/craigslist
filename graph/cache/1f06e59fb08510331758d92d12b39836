    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote.

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do.

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <li><strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 </li>
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <li><strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 </li>
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <li><strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 </li>
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <li><strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  </li>
  <li>3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>

<p> </p>
<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>
  
  
    <div><strong> We can fix:</strong><br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<br>

<br>
We are a resource for local cyclists and a center for skills training for kids <br>
from low-income communities. Staffed with a shop mentor, mechanics and volunteers, <br>
the Bike Hut is a place to rent bikes, learn to build and repair them, and buy parts and accessories. <br>
Whether you want to rent a bike for a ride on the Embarcadero, pick up some new gear, <br>
or just learn more about bikes, stop by the Bike Hut.<br>
<br>
The Bike Hut is open from 10 AM to 5 PM Wednesday through Sunday <br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>

 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>

  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>

<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p>
<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
 WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>
  
  
    <div><strong> We can fix:</strong><br>

If you are visiting San Francisco and would like to tour San Francisco's "Back Yard" by way of single track , dirt and a little mud for good taste. Then ZGx2 Back Yard Mountain Bike Tours is for you. These tours are 2~3 hour strenuous rides that will take you to parts of San Francisco that other tours would never dare take you. Golden Gate Park, Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge. $50.00 per person up to 4. $40.00 per person 5 or more. Must have your own Mt. Bike though I could help you to rent one. Cycle Cross bikes okay as well. You must be reasonably fit as these rides are meant to be challenging. <br>
<br>
Can also do Marin County, Repak, Mt Tam tours as well.

<p> </p>
<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>
  
  
    <div><strong> We can fix:</strong><br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue.

<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. </li>
</ul>
<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p>
<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
 WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>
  
  
    <div><strong> We can fix:</strong><br>

Greetings denizens of craigslist!<br>
<br>
I'm in the process of forming a nonprofit community bicycle organization to provide vocational and life skills training to at risk youth while educating and empowering community members to repair, maintain, and build their own bicycles. <br>
<br>
I'm financing the start up of this project by myself, so in order to help raise funds for it and begin connecting with the community, I'm offering sliding scale repair services. I'm an experienced mechanic who volunteers extensively at a variety of community organizations and receives professional training. If you simply want someone to fix your bike, I can bring the tools and stand and do it for you at home, or you can drop off your bicycle with me, whatever works for you! I'm also happy to teach you how to work on your own bicycle if you wish to learn how to solve your problems yourself in the future. Give me a call and tell me what's up with your bike and we'll figure out how to move forward! I'm offering sliding scale rates considerably lower than the 60-80 per hour you'll find in most bike shops. I'm also open to work/skill trade if you need bicycle services but lack the funds to pay anyone to help you.<br>
<br>
Hit me up!<br>

<font size="2">
<p>"Michael was incredibly thorough, helpful and informative!
My bike sat in storage for over a year and had never had a tune up. Michael came prepared to fill my tires with air, clean my chain, etc., and get rid of rust on my handlebars. 
I will definitely call Michael again when I need bike repairs or maintenance!" - Alycia.</p>
<p>"Michael is a pure craftsman. He does not rush what he does but makes sure everything is perfect.
I would highly recommend him.." - John.</p>
<p>"Michael has an outstanding service.  He arrived at the time agreed upon, setup shop in my garage and did an assessment of what my bike needed.  He performed a turn-up on not only my bike, but my daughters as well.  Its running great!  Thanks Michael!" - Rod.</p>
<p>"I came in for a routine tune-up and ended up with Michael tricking out my bike.  He not only did a tune-up, but installed new petals, new lights, a mirror and fresh brake pads at a great price.  In addition, he fixed the broken gear and the random squeaks my bike had accumulated through city commuting.  Overall, my bike is operating more smoothly than it ever has.
I highly recommend Michael and I'm sure I'll be using him again in the future." - Dan.</p>
<p>"Michael was very easy to schedule and communicate with.
Over two sessions he looked over my bike, informed me of what needed or could be done, and gave it a tune up. I described the mysterious noises and odd problems of my bike and he diagnosed them - he looked over the entire bike, replaced my severely damaged bottom bracket spindle and rear wheel hub, cleaned the chain, re-packed the headset, replaced the brake cables, and put on new brake levers.
It was incredibly helpful and convenient that he was able to come to my location to do the work as my bicycle was not in riding condition. Michael worked quickly within my time constraints and schedule and for a competitive rate. He was able to answer the many questions I had and made sure to keep me updated as new difficulties cropped up. 
Highly recommended." - Jess.</p>

<b><font size="5">Testimonials</font></b>
<font size="2">
<p>"Thanks for your help, Mike!  He showed up at our agreed upon time, brought all the tools and stand to get my bike back in working order and spent time to do a very, very thorough job.  I was impressed with his meticulous cleaning of my cassette and ability to adjust my broken derailleur.
I made sure to tip him since he also threw in new cables for the derailleur, too.  He mentioned that if anything needs adjustment in the next few days to give him a call.
-Punctual
-Thorough
-Meticulous
-Genuine " - Nick</p>
<p>"Michael's services really helped me understand why my bike wasn't working correctly and why there were unusual noises. I came to him thinking I would only need to adjust the brake levers, but I was wrong. He told me that adjustments needed to be made on the brake cables, chain, wheels, and spokes.I could tell that once he saw the bike, he knew what its problems were. He not only fixed the bike, but taught me what was wrong and what I needed to do if it happened again. Bottomline, Michael knows what he is doing and he offers his services at a very affordable price." - Calvin</p>
<p>"Michael is AWESOME! He comes to your door, diagnoses your bike problems, communicates clearly what needs to be done, gives you advice, and he clearly knows what he's doing. Your bike is in good hands with Michael. He's friendly, easy-going, knowledgable, and inexpensive! 20 bucks and my junky bike was like new.
I didn't have an area for him to work on my bike, so he brought up his tools to my top-floor apartment and worked on both of my bikes on my tiny balcony, in the freezing SF cold. He's a solid guy all-around, but an even better bike tech. 
Did I mention he comes to you? Definitely recommending him to everyone I know." - Fhay</p>
<p>"I could not possibly sing enough praises for Mike's work, additude, and reliability.  Not to mention his incredibly fair pricing.
I brought him a Bianchi bike, completely disassembled, that I was giving as a gift to a cute girl I know.  I was trying to impress her, and boy did Mike help!  Not only did he charge me about half of what Valencia Cyclery quoted me, he performed all of the work in less than 24 hours, perfectly.  He even took apart and cleaned the bottom bracket and frame as an added bonus, which was not included in the original scope.  Mike is a very competent, professional, friendly and capable bike mechanic, and I will use him for all my bicycle needs as long as he is in the business, which I hope is a long time!  
Needless to say, the cute girl was very impressed and we've enjoyed several long bike rides together.
Thanks Mike!
-Ben
P.S.  If this glowing review sounds suspicious, it's not!  I had never met Mike before he performed work for me!  I'm just extremely happy with his service! " - Ben</p>
<p>"I was ready to buy a new bike because my old one was no in top notch shape.
I used Michael's services and now I have a perfect running bike,,,he even cleaned it for me !
I HIGHLY recommend Michael's services to anyone who needs fast , reliable repairs,, ON TIME AND ON BUDGET !! 
New bike shops probably do not want you to know about BICYCLE CONNECT,,,but I do." - Michael</p>
<p>"Mike is a top notch bicycle mechanic and his prices are quite competitive.  He's professional, courteous and most of all, reliable..." - Francis</p>
<p>"Give Mike a try.  He offered a friendly, educational, and as it turned out, a top notch tuning of my bike.  Mike is a biking aficionado that seemingly loves to share his joy and knowledge for bikes." - Peter</p>
<p>"I trust Michael with my bike for any and all repairs.  Many times he has come to my rescue whether I need information, advise or repairs he's always there and right on.  Michael has a real passion for cycling, knows his stuff and loves the art. " - Ric</p>
<p>"Mike kept my Fuji touring bike finely tuned and in great shape, and even taught me a few things about keeping my bike at its best. Whether riding across the city, or down the state coast, I could always rely on Mike to keep my bike in the best condition. Anything from simple repairs, tune ups to upgrades, this guy knows his stuff, he's easy to get along with, he's fast, and best of all he's an honest guy who won't rip you off. Thanks for being so reliable, Mike!" - Chris</p>

<br>
A common and legit question!  The most accurate answer is that it depends on where you ride, what conditions you ride in and how much you ride!  A bicycle is a machine...all machines need some form of continuous care.</font></td>

<b><font size="5">Testimonials</font></b>
<font size="2">
<p>"Thanks for your help, Mike!  He showed up at our agreed upon time, brought all the tools and stand to get my bike back in working order and spent time to do a very, very thorough job.  I was impressed with his meticulous cleaning of my cassette and ability to adjust my broken derailleur.
I made sure to tip him since he also threw in new cables for the derailleur, too.  He mentioned that if anything needs adjustment in the next few days to give him a call.
-Punctual
-Thorough
-Meticulous
-Genuine " - Nick</p>
<p>"Michael's services really helped me understand why my bike wasn't working correctly and why there were unusual noises. I came to him thinking I would only need to adjust the brake levers, but I was wrong. He told me that adjustments needed to be made on the brake cables, chain, wheels, and spokes.I could tell that once he saw the bike, he knew what its problems were. He not only fixed the bike, but taught me what was wrong and what I needed to do if it happened again. Bottomline, Michael knows what he is doing and he offers his services at a very affordable price." - Calvin</p>
<p>"Michael is AWESOME! He comes to your door, diagnoses your bike problems, communicates clearly what needs to be done, gives you advice, and he clearly knows what he's doing. Your bike is in good hands with Michael. He's friendly, easy-going, knowledgable, and inexpensive! 20 bucks and my junky bike was like new.
I didn't have an area for him to work on my bike, so he brought up his tools to my top-floor apartment and worked on both of my bikes on my tiny balcony, in the freezing SF cold. He's a solid guy all-around, but an even better bike tech. 
Did I mention he comes to you? Definitely recommending him to everyone I know." - Fhay</p>
<p>"I could not possibly sing enough praises for Mike's work, additude, and reliability.  Not to mention his incredibly fair pricing.
I brought him a Bianchi bike, completely disassembled, that I was giving as a gift to a cute girl I know.  I was trying to impress her, and boy did Mike help!  Not only did he charge me about half of what Valencia Cyclery quoted me, he performed all of the work in less than 24 hours, perfectly.  He even took apart and cleaned the bottom bracket and frame as an added bonus, which was not included in the original scope.  Mike is a very competent, professional, friendly and capable bike mechanic, and I will use him for all my bicycle needs as long as he is in the business, which I hope is a long time!  
Needless to say, the cute girl was very impressed and we've enjoyed several long bike rides together.
Thanks Mike!
-Ben
P.S.  If this glowing review sounds suspicious, it's not!  I had never met Mike before he performed work for me!  I'm just extremely happy with his service! " - Ben</p>
<p>"I was ready to buy a new bike because my old one was no in top notch shape.
I used Michael's services and now I have a perfect running bike,,,he even cleaned it for me !
I HIGHLY recommend Michael's services to anyone who needs fast , reliable repairs,, ON TIME AND ON BUDGET !! 
New bike shops probably do not want you to know about BICYCLE CONNECT,,,but I do." - Michael</p>
<p>"Mike is a top notch bicycle mechanic and his prices are quite competitive.  He's professional, courteous and most of all, reliable..." - Francis</p>
<p>"Give Mike a try.  He offered a friendly, educational, and as it turned out, a top notch tuning of my bike.  Mike is a biking aficionado that seemingly loves to share his joy and knowledge for bikes." - Peter</p>
<p>"I trust Michael with my bike for any and all repairs.  Many times he has come to my rescue whether I need information, advise or repairs he's always there and right on.  Michael has a real passion for cycling, knows his stuff and loves the art. " - Ric</p>
<p>"Mike kept my Fuji touring bike finely tuned and in great shape, and even taught me a few things about keeping my bike at its best. Whether riding across the city, or down the state coast, I could always rely on Mike to keep my bike in the best condition. Anything from simple repairs, tune ups to upgrades, this guy knows his stuff, he's easy to get along with, he's fast, and best of all he's an honest guy who won't rip you off. Thanks for being so reliable, Mike!" - Chris</p>

I am offering motorcycle tire installing services in the Fairfield, Suisun, Vacaville area. At this time, concentrating mostly on Japanese / European sport bikes with conventional two sided swing arms. If you need your wheels removed from the bike, I can handle that part too. As time goes on, I will increase the bike categories. I use the No-Mar tire machine which is a manual machine that uses high density plastic on all the parts of the machine that contacts the wheel. No more scratching of wheels when you get your tires replaced. Static balancing of the tires is included in the price. I also have some nice 82 degree angled metal (aluminum) valve stems that can be installed at time of tire work. $36 a pair installed. I am available from 9am- 8pm most all days. You will need to call ahead and make an appointment. If you want to ship new tires here ahead of time, that's cool too. That way you can ride your bike here, I pull the wheels for you and install the new tires. If you leave the old tires here, there will be a small charge to dispose of them. Prices start at $15.00 (carry-ins) and go from there depending on your needs. I also sell Steel Horse Fabrications brand motorcycle maintence stands, if you care to pull your own wheels.  I have front and rear stands available that will work on all Japanese / European  sportbikes (two sided swing arm designs). They can be reviewed at www.steelhorsefab.com  I am located in Suisun City, just off highway 12. Call 707 427 1086 with any application questions or to set up a time. Ask for Ken

I will repair your bicycle for cheap! Any kind: old, new, road, Triathlon, BMX, mountain, hybrid, and commuter. . . Whatever it is I can do it! <br>
<br>
Qualifications: I've been racing downhill mountain bikes for 5 years and have been my own mechanic for all 5 of them. I have quite a bit of experience taking bikes apart and rebuilding them. I also have a lot of experience tuning them as well. I've built numerous bikes, as well. If that's not enough, I also work for a bike shop. I know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
If you're looking to have a bike built, converted, repaired or tuned, have parts to install, or even want my advice on something shoot me an email, text message, or give me a call. If you don't know what needs to be done, I'll give you a free evaluation. If you do know what needs to be done, let me know and I can do it for you!<br>

I will repair your bicycle for cheap! Any kind: old, new, road, Triathlon, BMX, mountain, hybrid, and commuter. . . Whatever it is I can do it! <br>
<br>
Qualifications: I've been racing downhill mountain bikes for 5 years and have been my own mechanic for all 5 of them. I have quite a bit of experience taking bikes apart and rebuilding them. I also have a lot of experience tuning them as well. I've built numerous bikes, as well. If that's not enough, I also work for a bike shop. I know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
If you're looking to have a bike built, converted, repaired or tuned, have parts to install, or even want my advice on something shoot me an email, text message, or give me a call. If you don't know what needs to be done, I'll give you a free evaluation. If you do know what needs to be done, let me know and I can do it for you!<br>
<br>
Email is at the top.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

What is TRX Suspension Training?<br>
Born in the U.S. Navy SEALS and developed by Fitness Anywhere, Suspension Training is a revolutionary method of leveraged bodyweight exercise. The TRX allows you to safely perform hundreds of exercises that build power, strength, flexibility, balance, mobility, and prevent injuries, all at the intensity you choose.<br>
<br>
"TRX has taken my functional strength, core stability, and overall muscle health to a new level. It is part of my daily routine that also keeps me injury free. It's great to take it on the road with me, as well as do it at home or at the gym. Ironman is so much more than swim, bike, run - I can't imagine training without TRX." <br>
Lindsey Corbin--Professional Tri-Athlete<br>
<br>
The TRX --RIP Trainer<br>
. . ..is the perfect match to Suspension Training. Another fabulous tool that allows for high metabolic work-outs challenging and pushing your aerobic-anaerobic threshold and improve VO2max. It increases muscle strength in legs, upper body, and core while allowing for 3D movement patterns that will increase rotational power. The RipTrainer is a great way to improve muscular imbalances helping to prevent back injuries.<br>
<br>
"I, like many other triathletes, have limited time. I am not your typical professional athlete that eats, sleeps, works out and gets massages every day. I have a full time job and business to run, I am married, teach 3 to 4 classes a week and try to have a social life as most of my friends are not athletes. It's hard, but the point is that I have little time. I have to be very efficient and effective in any training that I do. The TRX is a 3x week 30 min workout for me. It makes it possible for me to be strong, avoid injury and have the lifestyle that I do. . . I truly believe that 3 times a week for 30 minutes on the TRX will help prevent overuse injuries, create more power/strength that leads to time improvements as well as becoming more aware of your body and how it all works together to move you forward." <br>
Tyler Stewart--Pro Tri-Athlete<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>
  </li>

   WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

   WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote.

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>

  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>

  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p>
<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>
  
  
    <div><strong> We can fix:</strong><br>

My name is Craig Fury. I have over 20 years experience in motorcycle repair, and have built Harleys for many of those years. From flatheads to twin cams, to complete rebuilds - I HAVE DONE IT ALL.

Happy Customer Review: <br>
Patrick was one of the most friendliest mechanics I ever met. He walked me through a very thorough inspection of my BMW (r75 airhead). I now have my Moto Guzzi (850 lemans) with him now. I can't wait to get it back because my BMW never ran so well!!! He is a diamond in the rough, of shops that have over charged me, and didn't fix my issues! Patrick is a guy to know...He even picked up the bike for $50 bucks when I got quoted from shops at over $200. He was extremely fair and a pleasure to know. I will definitely be using him again!  Thanks GREYDOGMOTO! Ralph<br>

Hello fellow Vintage Motorcycle Owners, <br>
<br>
Mechanic (primarily vintage) AIR-COOLED (airhead) - BMW, Moto Guzzi, Brits...etc. (no more ground up motor rebuilds or basket cases...sorry), and some Japanese depending year, make and model. If your bike has been sitting for a while or needs service, just pick up the line or email me..let's get you back on the road. If it's leaning on the side of the house let's get you leaning with it, but on the road! I have a small shop/garage in Alameda, and service for all above including machining, welding and painting. I know that a lot of shops are not taking in these early model beauties, and some of them my refer to me anyway... I'm a one man show here, so getting things right the first time and completed in a timely manner is priority one. Ask me for any references and I'll be happy to provide. Many years of aggravating experience, not yet totally bald, but working on my fade, and some gray hair coming in nicely. Lets see if I can help you get that cafe bike, or dusty Sunday rider back up to Alice's Restaurant huh? THANKS! <br>
<br>
All the best, <br>
Patrick (aka Trick) <br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>

    Believe it or not, most laptop/pc issues are relatively simple to fix. But  most repair shops don't have the 'know-how' to do the job to the component level  like we are able to. That's where we come in. <br>
    We can give you the lowest repair rate possible simply because we can fix to that  faulty component which causes your whole motherboard not to function. 

<p> Clients have given us feedback that they have been shopping around at Fry's    Electronics, Best Buy, the pc manufacturers and various laptop repair    shops and came away with an astronomical repair quote. More often than not,    they are told to replace the whole motherboard which, more often than not is    not necessary. Don't waste time any further, because our facility is the    home to the best and most precise technicians to ease your hassles. We are The    Laptop Doctor<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>

  WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <li><strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 </li>
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <li><strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 </li>
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <li><strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 </li>
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <li><strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  </li>
  <li>3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>

<p> </p><h2><strong>Why  shouldn't I bring my video game console to somebody working from his garage?</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many of this house shops actually do greater  damage than repair to your game console, since they don't have the specialized  equipment, parts, training, or experience that we do. We specialize in video  game console refurbishing, so you'll know that your repair will be completed  quickly and professionally the first time.            </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p> It would be more costly for you to re-repair  your console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will pay twice on service, parts, plus repair what  the original problem was. In another words you will pay $120 (USD) for a $40  (USD) repair. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guessing work it would cost you money, our employees  are specialized and constantly trained and updating, while the guys from the  garage knowledge is outdated, remember!! <strong>Technology  changes every day.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fix  thousands of these errors every year. Yes, thousands. We are no "work out  of my garage" company. And our Techs are gamers, just like you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCC Computers is The  trusted game console repair center for some of the Retail chains in the bay  area.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember  you get what you pay for!</p>

 WHY IS OUR REPAIR SERVICE BETTER THAN THE REST?<br>
  You may be wondering what sets or repair process apart from some other less expensive .<br>
<br>
 <strong>OUR EQUIPMENT IS STATE OF THE ART.</strong><br>
 
  Unlike most other "repair services" that use heat guns, blow torches & inferior Chinese, light bulb, infrared machines, the equipment we use to fix your computer cost thousands of dollars, is of the highest quality German Black Infrared heating elements and is computerized itself which assures a professional and correct fix for the issue. Most other "repair" services fail again quickly.<br>
 
<br>
 <strong>WE RE-BALL CHIPS WHEN NEEDED AT NO EXTRA COST</strong><br>
 
 
    We have all the equipment to Re-ball BGA chips that require this procedure. While most blow dryer "fixers" would not be able to reball or replace BGA chips such as your video chip if their "repair" goes wrong. There is no additional charge for the labor for this service.<br>
 
 
<br>
 <strong>EDGE BONDING TECHNOLOGY</strong><br>
 
  After we repair and test your unit we use professional compounds and machinery to "edge bond" your video chip the board. This GREATLY reduces future chip failures. Our competitors do not do this so the problem will more than likely come back with their "fix"<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>NO FIX, NO PAY.</strong><br>
  
  3 month warranty    for all services (parts and labor).<br>
  
  Reasonable price: We    just need to replace the faulty chips to save the motherboard and reduce the    cost to you. <br>
  
  Quick turn around time    (expedite available at no extra cost): <br>
    <strong>Same day services </strong>for power jack and LCD repair (if in stock).<br>

I'll cut to the chase, the most up to date info can be found here on my website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crossrhodescycle.com">http://www.crossrhodescycle.com</a><br>
<br>
But here's a quick summary.  If you have a problem with your bike or you need help with assembly, this, that, or the other in the Pleasanton area, please get in touch!<br>
I can do simple flat tire repairs to full-on overhauls. I'm an experienced mechanic (and enthusiastic rider) having kept a few dollars in the bank account through college by wrenching on bikes of all kinds. I'm happy to work on most anything with two wheels and pedals. Road bikes (my favorite), mountain bikes (I own one of those too), kids bikes (a couple in my garage), and other bicycle-like vehicles. I do my work in my garage in Pleasanton.<br>
<br>
Here's a sampling of services and costs:<br>
Wheel true - $12 and up<br>
Flat repair - $12, including tube<br>
Tune up - $40 (adjust brakes and shifting, true wheels, snug bolts and bearings, wipe down)<br>
Bike fit - $varied<br>
Accessory installation - $varied<br>
<br>
Prices can adjust a bit based on the complexity of your bike (a full-suspension MTB vs. a kids bike for example).  If I can't fix it, I'll let you know up front. I'm far less expensive than a traditional bike shop and super easy to deal with. I'm generally available for bike work in the evenings and on weekends due to my "real" job, but feel free to get in touch at any time.<br>
