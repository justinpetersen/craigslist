Hi! How are you? Hope you are doing well... Thanks for checking out my cl post!<br>
 <br>
I was wondering if you could tell me what you prefer more...thongs or panties (or going commando)? Why did you choose the one you like the most? Due to comfort, style or to show off in the end? I think thongs are pretty sexy! Thanks for reading my cl post and giving your input... <br>

 I wanna find me a fag hag - someone who's comfortable with a gay best friend, so much so that we can be Jack and Karen to each other, lol!! I'm lovely, rofl, so you b2 - I can carry on more than a decent conversation as I am rather well-educated and even easy on the eyes, and am looking to find me a hag whom I can be both daft and serious with, the way close friends always are.<br>

Hello I'm looking for someone with similar interests to me. I love music, art, fashion, videogames, computers, concerts conventions, comics, anime, manga, cooking, gardening, reading, hanging around doing nothing, going out for coffee or tea, and walking around with no destination.<br>
<br>
I don't do drugs and I drink maybe twice a year. I do smoke cigarettes though. I'm not a fan of going to clubs either.<br>
<br>
I don't care about appearances, weight, religion, sexuality. But please be female and between 18 -24. I'm only 20 myself so I'd prefer to get to know someone closer to my own age.<br>
<br>
If it sounds like we have similar interests either send me an email or you can yim me at singhs96. :D<br>

 Hullo, <br>
<br>
 I am still somewhat new to the area and don't know other hikers yet. It makes it especially hard on my hiking, as I am an inveterate hiker and do relish the opportunity to do nature treks, although I never really average more than 8 miles per jaunt. I don't know the area too well and am therefore looking for a friend to introduce me to the local delights, such as they are, lol. I can carry on more than a decent conversation and am a decent pal, so email me if you plan on going hiking sometime soon. I love riding my bicycle all the time, so I seem to be especially geared towards the old ways of Mother Nature and am therefore looking to apply that to my hiking in the near future.<br>
<br>
 Thanks ever so for reading and happy trails!!!<br>
<br>
 P.S. No unsavory characters with unsavory offers, please - this is solely a hiking buddy post, nothing more.

I am a bi woman who is mainly lacking platonic girlfriends. I especially don't have any lesbian friends, and feel I have to live a 'straight' life because I am in Marin.<br>
<br>
I would be open to more than a friendship if it works, but right now I don't feel ready for that. But I am lonely and would love to have lesbian friends to socialize with. I love to bike, so a biking partner would be great. I also love to go out dancing, but never have anyone to go out with.<br>
<br>
Please contact me if you are interested in hanging out, and are okay with a platonic friend for now...<br>

We can hit up one of the hot clubs (I have a few in mind). If it works out, we could make it a regular thing. All your cover and drinks are on me, all you have to do is thrown on a pair of heels and club outfit. While there, you are free to be as debaucherous with other guys as you like. Actually I encourage it. As for me, I am nice, pretty passive, and friendly.

Affectionate friends are the best. You don’t ever date them so you don’t ever lose them yet you get the benefits of cuddling and feeling great =) I am a cute fit San Jose guy looking for a new friend. I get along better with girls probably because of the activities that I like to do which include cooking, walking my dog, lunches, shopping for stuff, watching movies and favorite tv shows. Anyone want to chat and trade pics? :p

I am looking for a fun, flirty, day and night in San Francisco with an attractive, fun loving woman.  I am not looking to hook up just to flirt, and share some time in the city with someone who wants to hang out with someone new.  I am staying near Stanford and leave tomorrow.  I will cover the costs of our sightseeing.  You should send a pic in your reply. <br>

If you want to meet up with a friend along for safety that is cool!<br>

I am not looking to hook up just to flirt, and share some time in the city with someone who wants to hang out with someone new.  I am staying near Stanford and leave tomorrow.  I will cover the costs of our sightseeing.  You should send a pic in your reply. <br>
<br>
If you want to meet up with a friend along for safety that is cool!<br>
<br>
I will text you a photo if you send me yours.<br>

I am feeling a strong urge now to learn to dance the Tango and I think it is best to have a (more or less) regular partner to do this with.  I have danced Salsa for many years but now want to branch out and am seeking a female partner who also has an interest in the Tango.  This is not complicated -  my idea is simply to start to take lessons on a regular basis here in the East Bay.  I would like someone who is perhaps a couple inches shorter than me (I am 5'11", 150lbs.) and thus someone between 5'6" and 5'9" (height/weight proportional), my age or younger would probably be ideal.  This is a strictly platonic proposal and so I am not asking for anything more, just a willingness and capability to learn and dance the Tango, "Argentine" style.  If you have already taken a few basic lessons I am sure that would be OK but if you are already pretty good at the Tango, you would probably be frustrated with me as I am new to this dance (even though I really do have some proven partner dance abilities with Salsa).  So, what do you think?  If you have an interest and respond, I would be happy to share with you a bit more about myself.  Have a great day!

I have plenty of girl friends in the city and gay guy friends, but all of the straight guys I meet are flakes or interested in something other than friendship. While I'd love to be attracted to you and engage in flirtatious, witty banter, I'd hope we could just hang out, try new restaurants, hit some bars, check out a movie, or take a hike outside the city. Are you well-educated, well-traveled, 28-36, and live near Russian Hill? Shoot me a message with what you like to do and a picture and maybe we can be friends... :-) List the last movie you saw or restaurant you tried in the subject line.

Been trying to level up my guild without anyone helping and you know, it's a royal pain in the kiester! Anyone out there in Craig'land want to start a toon on Ravencrest? I can set you up with bags, gold, power leveling and most any mats you'd need.<br>
<br>
I've currently got ten level 80-81 Horde toons on the server and in the guild. I can provide heals, rDPS, mDPS or tanking. Whatever type of toon you'd want to run would be fine. I can assure you that I've got at least 2-3 toons that'll compliment your choice.  :)<br>
<br>
I also have two accounts so I can have up to 20 toons on the server. That means I can have a new toon that runs with you, or I can use a higher level toon to coast you through low level stuff.<br>
<br>
And yes, this is 100% platonic. I get rather fed up when someone netsex's someone and have NO plans on ever being anything but a WoW player when I'm in the game. I might be interested in a shared Starbucks encounter (2 blocks from the house), but other than that - GAME ON!

Hi,<br>
I recently new to SF having moved from the East Bay and am looking to meet some new and interesting friends in the city. A bit about myself: 32 years old, Caucasian, professional, four year college graduate. Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to: hiking, tennis, movies, live music, and reading. I'm laid back, friendly, no drama. I am learning to become fluent Spanish so I can hopefully (crosses fingers) make it out to Spain sometime next year. Anyway, if you're interested in meeting up, feel free to drop me an email.

Hi,<br>
I recently new to SF having moved from the East Bay and am looking to meet some new and interesting friends in the city. A bit about myself: 32 years old, Caucasian, professional, four year college graduate. Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to: hiking, tennis, movies, live music, and reading. I'm laid back, friendly, no drama. I am learning to become fluent Spanish so I can hopefully (crosses fingers) make it out to Spain sometime next year. Anyway, if you're interested in meeting up, feel free to drop me an email.

I am looking for a serious relationship starting from friendship.<br>
<br>
I am divorced.  I was married for less than 3 years.   My ex-wife had faked marriage.  She married me even thought she had had a long time relationship with a City Worker.  They have been together for more than 15 years.  His name is Efren Ramos.  I could not believe the city worker encouraged and helped her fake marriage.<br>
<br>
I caught her they were having relationship once before we got married.  She told me that they broke up. I forgave her once.  She lay.  She could not have third chance.  I understood why she was always stubborn and very often refused to have sex.  They were meeting very often while I worked long hours to support our living.  Once she answered a phone when they were having sex.  I could have divorced her because I discovered that my Ex-wife and he went to Asia for a Vacation together.  She called me from Airport in Japan and disappeared for few days.  When I reached her in Japan she hang up Mobil phone because she was with him.  They had a vacation in  Philippine and Japan.  Once she miscarried a baby.  She was very stressing out about the pregnancy.  She did not tell me about her boyfriend at that time and she asked me to test my sperms when she found out she was pregnant.  My sperm counts were low.  The baby was not mine.  I am sorry for the baby.  Even thought the baby was not mine he could have lived if she lived honestly and did not have that much stress.<br>
<br>
My Ex-wife has not moved out from my place.  I do not understand her mentality even though she has financial problem.  Her boyfriend told me that he would like to take responsibility.  He should help her finance and moving.  However, he has not done anything.  Is Efren just using her for Sex?<br>
<br>
My Ex has to go.  I need to move on.  I was depressed for more than two years.  I took personal counseling at a Clinic in the City.  Now my insurance has discontinued and I am not able to have the counseling.  I am receiving big bills.<br>
<br>
I like to meet honest and good people who have positive minds.  Please do not contact me if you feel sorry for me.  This is a good opportunity to improve myself.  Thank you.

I'm interested in talking to someone new and that new person might be you.  I'm married, so if you are married, then we can talk about being married or what not.  If you aren't married and want to talk, that's fine too.  We can talk about christmas plans for the kids, sports, movies, travel, walking, reading, adults, or literally anything.  It's the weekend, so what are you gonna do?  Anything great?  Hope to read your words soon.

Hey There! I'm a bright, fun, well-educated guy, who's lived in SF most of my life. <br>
<br>
Several years ago, I was diagnosed with a genetic eye condition, which you cannot tell by looking at me, or spending time with me, but it has resulted in a fairly serious diminishment of my central vision, although I still have a lot of useful vision, and my peripheral vision is still pretty-good... <br>
<br>
As a result, I've had to cut back on my work and some activities...I've learned to make the best of things, and I've learned a lot about myself from this experience, and am still very-active and engaged with life and various activities...However, I now have a fair-amount of free time on my hands, and my vision situation can make it tough to make new friends, since I can't readily tell if someone's waving hello, or giving me a friendly smile... <br>
<br>
I would love to connect with someone to hang out from time-to-time, do things around the city, and get to know each other over time, and develop a real friendship. <br>
<br>
I'm in my mid-40's, look and feel much younger, am Caucasian, healthy, exercise regularly and lead a healthy lifestyle. I am not into drugs or heavy alcohol, and am still very physically active and love to hike, take long walks, exercise, etc., with some mobility cane use during the brighter parts of the day, but generally not in the evening, or at night, when I tend to see better... <br>
<br>
My interests include Art, Music, History (was an Art History major/History minor in college), Buddhism (I study and practice Tibetan Buddhism). I still enjoy film, TV, Theater and concerts, exploring the city, long walks in Golden Gate Park, modified hiking in Marian, etc., dining-out in interesting, 'neighborhood' restaurants, and going-out for food, coffee/tea, or a drink and conversation with friends, or just 'hanging-out' at home, relaxing and talking, or listening to music. <br>
<br>
I am looking to develop a friendship with people of any background, ethical and/or belief system, or sexual-orientation, who are 21 to 60, warm, well-rounded, healthy in body, speech and mind, with varied interests/activities, and who are open-minded abut my visual-impairment, and who don't see it as an 'impediment' to friendship and/or activities, as I don't see it as one for myself! :) <br>
<br>
I have some free time during the week, as well as some weekends and evenings...I also love conversing by phone, if you don't have a lot of time to meet and hang out in-person. <br>
<br>
It would be great to make some new friends, as many of my older friends are tied-up with family, relationships, or have moved out of the area, so am looking to expand my social network. <br>
<br>
If any of this resonates with you, feel-free to send me a description of yourself, your interests, availability, and perhaps a face pic, only so I have some idea of who I'm writing to, (I can blow it up on my computer), and I will return the favor. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your interest, and I look forward to getting to know you soon! :) <br>

Hey! I once made a post up on here a couple months ago and met someone really cool so I'm hoping for the same results again. :)<br>
I'm 18, live in campbell and I'm just looking for new buddies to kick it with. <br>
My interests include: photography, raving (that would be a major plus if you like to go out and have a good time!), writing, watching movies, reading, exploring the bay area, tumblring (lol) and meeting new people. <br>
Hit me up if you're interested in meeting up to perhaps get some grub and chat a little. <br>
Your pic gets mine!

Divorce is more and more in my past each day but not ready for something new. Just want to take you to lunch and do something after if you would like. Polite guy with a Monty Python like humor. Can make small talk about almost anything,exchange funny stories or talk about silly stuff we have seen in the news. You pick I'll pay ( within reason ) if that's OK. Just be able to chew with your mouth closed, know what fork to use when and don't start a food fight. SWM 5'10", average build looking for SWF with humor. I haven't skated in 30 years so be ready to laugh. Please enclose some general info about yourself in reply. Want to weed out the " I need a green card "replies.

Hi<br>

I am in search of new friends to get out and do things with. I am living near Livermore so would like to have friends near if possible, if not I don't mind meeting in the middle. I like live music, dancing, flea markets, shopping, dining out, etc. If you have any interest please email me a little about yourself.<br>

Hi I am in search of some new friends, (guys or girls). At my age it seems so hard to meet good people to hang with. Most people are so flakey. I am looking to replace all my old flakey friends with new friends. If you are in the same boat email me and let's chat.<br>

Right now what I'm looking for and needing is just a good friendship without any of the complications or pressures that seem to go along with dating or pursuing a relationship. And no, I'm definitely not interested in a "friends with benefits" situation either.<br>
<br>
Yes, I do believe men and women can initiate and maintain a good friendship without the need to push for more. Right now I have a lot on my plate and going through some challenges and would love to just have someone in my life to grab a cup of coffee with, talk and listen with and maybe go out occasionally for dinner or drinks when time and schedules allow.  This is where I am at right now and I wanted to see if there might be someone else out there who's needing the same thing in their life for now.<br>
<br>
If this sincerely sounds like you please respond and we'll go from there.<br>
<br>
Good luck to us all :)

Let's recognize another thing. Deep down inside, you don't want to be alone for the holidays. You want someone to do all of those cute snugging things with, someone to get fat and keep warm next to and someone to accompany you to your friends' holiday parties.<br>
<br>
But, you've spent all year working on your career  and haven't had the time or inclination to track down and capture a boyfriend. <br>
<br>
The solution:<br>
Be my friend  for the holidays. <br>
<br>
How it works:<br>
You reply with a picture and a brief bi. If it seems like a good fit we'll set up a casual mini-date (coffee, beer, or whatever). If that's a success and we're both feeling it. Great.<br>
<br>
The benefits:<br>
&#65533; You have someone to keep you company on these witch-tit-cold  nights. Did I mention I'm an excellent cuddlier? <br>
&#65533; Worried about finding someone to kiss on New Year's Eve who doesn't look (or sound) like Sloth's cousin? Boom! Got you covered.<br>
<br>
About Me:<br>
30years old, Asian 5'9. Good Looking and looks 24 years old. Single with no strings attach. Really.   Employ at current job for past 5 years after college, outgoing, easy on the eyes.<br>
<br>
Interested? Then send your pic and bio and get this ball rolling.<br>

So here's the deal.  I am NOT here looking for a relationship, but a friendship.  I am NOT looking to hook up or interfere with a marriage or relationship.<br>
<br>
I'm a simple girl.  I like to laugh, so you must have a sense of humor!  Must be be able to laugh at yourself and life.  Like outdoorsy stuff...walking, hiking etc.  Like music, movies, being outside.  Looking for a friend with the same qualities.  If you are simple and want to share some laughs, reply :-)  Simple!

I'm a college student who moved to the area a few years ago, and I still haven't found a lot of outdoorsy places to explore in Sonoma County. I have access to my campus gym, but I struggle to find the inspiration to go workout there. I much prefer  walking and being outdoors. :)<br>
<br>
I'm looking for someone close to my age (18-25) male or female who knows all the good places to hike, possibly Point Reyes or any state parks nearby. I'm trying to get back in shape, and it would be nice to have a friend (or group of friends) to walk with a few times a week. I'm very friendly, open-minded, and easy to get along with. I also love dogs, so someone who wants to bring along their pooch is a plus :)<br>
<br>
Shoot me an email if you're interested! Looking for strictly platonic

Hello. I hate to use the term lonely but there is no other way to describe my disposition this holiday season. (every holiday season)<br>
I don't have the focus for an emotional availability but I want a friend to take things slow with. To hang out with some nights. <br>
I am a big laugh-er. in the process of applying for grad school. too cool for school but a total dork all the same.<br>
I don't know what else to say except...i have been lonely. i am wonderful, chill, easy going, fab fun but a lil less social than i should be. <br>
ask me questions if you want to know more.

Gosh, hope that didn't sound too desperate lol<br>
Anyways, as you know already, I'm seeking to expand my horizons and looking for new people to either go out to weekend events, catch the latest deals on Groupon/Livingsocial with or just having a nice conversion about life.<br>
Don't get me wrong, I do have a group of friends and I love them to death but me and them have some interests we don't share nor am I the type of person content with doing the same activities 90% of the time so I'm hoping an individual or a group of people can help me fill that void.<br>
I enjoy talking about politics, the environment, social functions (I am a Sociology major afterall), Asian music, philosophy and current events.  I enjoy swimming, shopping around for deals, dancing, and cpop/kpop music.<br>
I'm mainly looking for someone who's around my age (20-26) and Asian, nothing personal it's just preference but if you're cool and down-to-Earth then I definitely wanna meet you as well! =)<br>
If all this sounds good just give me a brief description of yourself as well as tell me what you like to do during your free time and we can go from there! =)<br>

I am hosting an AWESOME party tonight at a great venue with a very well known DJ.  I am looking for a few absolute hotties to come join the party.  I am NOT trying to get with you, I don't need to invite girls to party for sex.  I just want a little extra hotness in the crowd tonight and I can make sure you cut the lines and get right in.  Be 21+ (mandatory) and absolutely hot.  I know it sounds shallow, but that's how it works.  I get you into the hottest party in SF tonight, you look amazing. There is potential for after parties and who knows who might be there.  We have partied with Ronnie from JS and numerous other celebrities, so don't act crazy if you see them out with us.

Hi there. <br>
<br>
I love Christmas time and I like going to renaissance faires. That makes Dickens Fair one of my favorite events of the year. I took my significant other last year and, to put it mildly, she wasn't into it.<br>
<br>
I have an extra ticket and am going tomorrow. I thought I would post and see if there were any ladies who might be looking for an escort to the fair. <br>
<br>
About me:<br>
40<br>
Caucasian <br>
Just shy of 6 feet<br>
Average build<br>
I am told I am kind on the eyes. <br>
I build websites for a living. <br>
I have a good sense of humor. <br>
<br>
About you:<br>
Actually, my only criteria here is that you want to go to the dickens fair. I don't care if you are fat, thin, young, old, white, black or brown. I am honestly not looking for anything more than a companion for an event. <br>
<br>
If it sounds interesting, we can meet for coffee or something to see if we can stand each other. Or talk in the phone or whatever. I am flexible. You need never reveal any personally identifying information to me if you don't want to. I will provide you info on who I am and you can see a copy of my drivers license in advance to make sure you are at ease. <br>
<br>
Bottom line: if you want to go to dickens fair and your circle of friends isn't into it, we might make a good pair for an afternoon.
