Looking for the right match to share our wonderful nanny--preferably a family with one child. Our nanny is amazing--beyond being great with our 6-month old son, super caring, smart, funny and legal. She is Trustline certified, has her First Aid and child CPR certificate, has the whooping cough and flu shot, a clean driving record and excellent references.  Her hours are 7:30 am to 3:30 pm. Her rate is $20/hour, which would be $10/child for shared hours.  She is a nanny through Danville's Nanny Connection and has excellent references. We are looking for a part-time or full-time share, we are flexible, but would like a committment of a set number of hours per week. We are located in Walnut Creek near Heather Farm.  <br>
<br>
If interested, please email with information on the age of your child, how many hours per week you are looking for, and when you would like to start care. Thanks.<br>

Our nanny needs a new family to take care of. She is absolutely terrific -- both of our children love her. She has worked for us for the last five years, taking care of both our children from the time they were infants to the time they entered preschool. Whenever I left for work in the morning, neither one of my children batted an eyelash. I always come home to lots of laughter and giggles. She took the kids out every day to places like the park, the library, and the zoo so I always knew they had lots of fun during their time with her. She is very caring, affectionate, reliable, and diligent about the safety of our kids. In addition to her many years of being a nanny, she has also raised five children of her own so she has plenty of experience and comes highly recommended by previous share families.<br>
<br>
Our nanny is looking for a full time position and is receptive to doing a share. If you are looking for someone who will lovingly take care of your kids, please e-mail for further details.<br>

<br>
Description:<br>
<br>
We are in need of a part-time experienced, responsible, dedicated, fun, loving, organized, reliable, flexible nanny for our three wonderful and well-behaved boys in Southern Novato! Their ages are 11, 8 & 5. Must be CPR certified, Trustline registered (or willing to be), have your own safe vehicle with a clean driving record to drive and pick up the boys from school in Novato, and get them to various sports, art class, etc. We are looking for someone who is fun, smart, active and energetic, who loves kids! Someone who is disciplined who can help oversee their homework assignments keeping them on-task, but then also go outside and play ball with them. Someone althletic and not afraid to get their hands a little dirty! Someone creative who can do art projects with them, prepare a healthy meal for them, read to them, take them on bike rides along with walking our dog (we have a chocolate lab). Overall, someone who will love being with them and who'll make sure they are safe and happy! On occasion, we need simple tasks done like putting the kids laundry away and helping the kids put their toys away. This person must also be a non-smoker with an extremely safe and reliable car with room for three passengers with a car seat. Must be able to provide at least three local references, proof of car insurance and clean driving record, and CPR certification. <br>

Ouch, some tips on how to handle a child's fall....read more at our blog and visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.Traditionstlc.com/">http://www.Traditionstlc.com/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Do you ever see a child who has fell and got hurt. Seems like it happens everyday, right? I have some great pointers on what to do when your child falls and hurts them selves. Of course if your child has been in an extreme accident, you don't want to have them move around because they may have broken a bone. But if it's just a regular everyday ouch, and your child falls, I feel the best thing to do is to stay very calm. When the child looks over for comfort from you and if you are all excited about the fall, then it will make them feel insecure and could escalate a very minor incident. After you have stayed calm, then with the straitest face you can have, very calmly and in the most loving tone of vice, ask the child to simply stand up and walk over to you to tell you about the fall. This serves several purpose's. First it allows you to see how hurt the child is. If the child jumps up and runs over to tell their story, then they are most likely fine and you can give them a kiss and tell them that everything is just fine and to run and play. But if there is some kind of limp or you see a trail of blood, then you may need to investigate the fall a bit more. If they cant get up, then you know it could be a very serious fall. Just use your best judgement when a child falls. Have a nice day :)

I am looking for a part time Nanny to take care of my newborn Son starting mid January.  He will be three months old.<br>
<br>
To start, I will only need one day a week, Thursday 10-6 and will soon add Friday.  Days will slowly build up to Wed-Friday and maybe eventually Tues-Friday.<br>
<br>
We are looking for someone who will love our sweet snuggly boy just as much as we do.  We would love Spanish as a first language, and can comunicate in Spanish a little bit ourselves, but this is not a requirement. <br>
Hopefully you like to go on walks and and love to talk, play, read and dance around.  He loves to be in the Bjorn and is a really calm sweet boy, just learning how to smile, and take pumped milk in a bottle :)<br>
Some light housework would be appreciated.  We have two very friendly dogs but no walking needed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Please contact me to talk if this sounds like it might be a good fit.  Thank you so much and Happy Holiday's.<br>
<br>
Best, <br>
<br>

My male nanny (experienced and age 30) is going to be available full time after the holidays. I am fortunate to be able to stay home at that time and regretfully will not need our beloved nanny (Jared) full time any longer. We have 2 boys (age 4 and 6)....he has been with us for almost 2 years and he is TREMENDOUS! I often share his services with other families at the same time....he is quite capable of watching multiple children and keeping them happy, calm, entertained and safe. Jared is vegan and has a very healthy lifestyle. He prepares healthy meals for the children and we feel comfortable knowing he is taking care of all their neeeds. He is prompt and reliable and we have zero complaints! He is usually always outside with the kids or doing some sort of activity. He is not a TV fan (unless I request a movie time or something special). The children are sad to not have him with us full time....but we will always have him around for part time needs and extra things. Jared will tailor his services to what you need. We had him do some laundry, clean up, house sitting, dog sitting, all aspects of child care including errands and driving to practices etc. We trust him implicitly in our home and with our children. Any family would be lucky to have Jared as part of their family as we do! You can contact him directly at 508.740.7574 (he is originally from Boston area but been on west coast for 2.5 years). For any references, I can also be contacted at 831.998.2657 or ask Jared for a listing of references. Thanks!<br>

Hi I am offering childcare in my home from 8am-6pm, can start an hour early if you want.  I am offering my services at $375 per week full time.  I am located in Redwood City off the Woodside Rd/Seaport Blvd exit off Woodside Rd and Hess Rd.  I am looking to care for 2 kids, I specialize in infant/toddler development and am currently in school, I have 24 ECE units, am currently working my my Master Teacher Permit, over 10 years of experience and 7 of those years with infants/toddlers, specialize in infant/toddler development/care, clean background/registered with Trustline, infant/toddler cpr certified, TB cleared and great references from previous families.  My usual rate is starting at $2,500.00 per month (and thats only for nannying NOT including light housekeeping or family assistant duties) but if care is provided at my place than I save a considerable amount on gas and insurance and travel time.  I go to school 6:30 on Mondays and 7:30pm Tuesdays-Fridays.  I am available to start asap.  Please respond if interested.  Thank you.

 I'm looking for flexible, parttime childcare help with my 16 month old daughter. I work from home, so I would need to bring her somewhere else, preferably in Fairfax or San Anselmo (unless I was having client meetings - in which my home would be free). Ideally, it would be great to be able to bring her somewhere for 3 hours late morning (which hopefully could be 4 hours or after naptime if I needed it for a client meeting). I thought the nanny share might be ideal because she could join in somewhere other than home, she could have a playmate that might become sibling-like over time, and lower cost for parents/higher earnings for the nanny during those hours.   <br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks so much!<br>
<br>
Busco a persona que me pueda ayudar con mi hija que tiene 16 meses. Trabajo desde mi casa, entonces necesito llevar mi hija a otra casa donde la puedan cuidar. Espero encontrar a alguien que cuide nios en Fairfax o San Anselmo. Idealmente, me gustaria llevar mi hija a otra casa con una nanny, que este cuidando a otros nios, por 3 horas por las maanas por 5 dias a la semana. Pero necesito un horario flexible por que tengo citas con clientes en diferente tiempos. Creo que esta situacion de que cuiden a mi hija fuera de la casa seria mejor, porque mi nia tendria a otros ninos cerca como hermanos, seria tambien un poco barrato y la nanny podria ganar mas. Si tiene usted una situacion similar, escribame por favor o llame al 415-505-4192.  Muchas gracias!

How We're Different<br>
<br>
We strive to ensure your child reaches his/her best potential in all areas of life, emotional, creative, well mannered and education; while learning the importance of diversity through our multi-cultured preschool and childcare.<br>
<br>
One way we provide this is through our pre-preschool program, a comprehensive play-based approach. Through this cirriculum system we have everything we need to successfully implement an intentional and comprehensive early childhood program.<br>
<br>
We help your child creatively weave together art projects, music, storytelling, math games and science experiments. The result is a meaningful learning experience where your child builds a foundation for lifelong learning.<br>
<br>
See our Pre-Preschool tab above for the exciting cirriculum that will take place starting in September, 2011!<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
How To Get Started<br>
<br>
 We will be conducting an open enrollment for our fall preschool sign ups.<br>
<br>
We maintain a structured preschool program catered to each individual child. You will be able to meet the staff and introduce your child to the facility. <br>
<br>
Limited applications will be handed out. We have a perfect balance of learning and play. We firmly believe preschool is the first introduction to a lifetime of learning, a journey that should start off on the right foot.<br>
<br>
Enrollment is on a first come first serve basis. We look forward to meeting you and your little one!<br>

From sunrise to sunset children will love participating in the art and science of life on the farm.<br>

 <br>
January- Dress up Jobs<br>
The new year brings an exciting opportunity for your children to take on new roles. Imagine wearing a sheriff's badge, fighting fires, or being a dentist for a day.

Transform your room into a nest of learning as new ideas hatch all around you.<br>
 <br>

Watch the sun set on a great year.<br>
 <br>
April- Baby Animals<br>
Children will ooh and ahh over this adorable theme filled with baby animals. From baby bunnies to lambs and fluffy chicks, this is a percect theme to celebrate spring's birth.

Hello, <br>
<br>
I am an experienced nanny with fantastic references and a genuine love for children! I take pride in the quality of care I provide. I maintain a safe, healthy, fun, enriched environment for all ages, and I enjoy every minute of it! <br>
<br>
Here's a quick break down of my qualifications: <br>
<br>
~6 years of full-charge nanny experience, currently run small in home childcare <br>
~Confident in caring for multiple children including all ages; infants, toddlers, and school aged children. <br>
~Fantastic references from previous employers <br>
~Bright, cheerful, "can-do" attitude with an ability to take initiative and communicate openly with parents (in person and through email or text) <br>
~Encourage and participate with children in imaginative and creative play <br>
~Maintain a clean, healthy environment as well as prepare and serve healthy and nutritious snacks and meals <br>
~Infant/child CPR and First Aid Certified/Registered with Trustline/18 units in Early Childhood education <br>
~Own car, clean driving record, full coverage car insurance <br>
<br>
<br>
I am currently seeking a new and exciting job with a fun and responsible family! I am looking for a position that guarantees at least 30 hours per week (preferably 30-45). <br>
<br>
If you would like to chat, I'd love to tell you more about myself and my experience. so send me an email and I will get back to you. <br>

Hello, My name is Jill. I am 32 years old and live in Campbell/Los Gatos area. I am CPR/FirstAid certified and registered with Trustline. I am currently attending West Valley College and finishing up my Early Childhood Education classes . I am pursing my life long dream of becoming a preschool or kindergarten teacher down the road. <br>
<br>
I am available Monday through Friday Full-Time. <br>
<br>
I'v been running my inhome childcare for over six years as well as being a nanny for two different families that moved out of state. <br>
<br>
I am more than willing to help around the house also, by helping with laundry, dishes, vacuuming, cooking, etc. <br>
I can also help your children with homework, and projects. <br>
I am also available to do over night sitting if needed. <br>
I do have experience with twins as well <br>
<br>
Watching and helping children grow and learn is one of my greatest passions. I love children, getting on the ground, rolling on the floor, reading them stories, playing games, singing songs, going to the park, anything that children love to do. I understand that growing children need alot of mental stimulation and love to explore. I want to help them accomplish that. <br>
<br>
I am(negotiable) depending on duties and your situation. I understand the economy is not that great right now for some of us. I am looking for hopefully 35+ hrs a week. <br>
<br>
If you would like to know more, or would like to talk to me about what your family needs are, feel free to email me at jillianortiz12@yahoo.com or call me at (408)250-0351. <br>
<br>
Have a wonderful day, and happy searching. <br>

ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION!<br>
<br>
Is your elementary child falling behind in school?<br>
<br>
Is he/she not focused or interested in doing homework? <br>
<br>
Do you live in Oakley, Brentwood or Antioch?<br>
<br>
If you answered yes, than know I can help.<br>
<br>
<br>
My passion from the time I decided I wanted to be a teacher has been to help young children reach their full potential. Focus, focus, focus. In my experience a young child's attention span is not their greatest attribute. As a parent of two wonderful children I say that with a wry smile. I try making lessons that are engaging and entertaining for children. It is very important to have the student's full attention. If the material is not delivered or taught in such a manner that students are interested than nothing will be absorbed. My methods not only help their capacity to learn, but also build confidence, self-esteem and self-worth. It is never too early for children to believe in themselves. When teaching comes from compassion and caring the results are unbounded. <br>
<br>
I charge $30 for a 50 minute one-on-one tutoring session. The remaining 10 minutes is for documenting the session and answer any parent questions. I am on average $15 less than other tutoring companies with a ratio greater than 1:1. <br>
<br>
Sessions are held in local libraries where parents are welcome to bring along siblings. Feel free to take the 50 minutes to read together or pick out a book to bring home.<br>
<br>
I graduated from San Francisco State in 2003 and went to Hayward where I completed courses for my teaching credential. I currently am acquiring certification in the Handwriting Without Tears education program while working as a teacher for a local tutoring company. <br>
<br>
Since 2004 I have worked in classrooms and conducted after school tutoring in language arts and mathematics for young children at all challenge levels. <br>

<br>
I am excited to use my strong educational background and long-time nanny experiences with infants and small children to become a part of another wonderful family. In 2009 I earned my Multiple Subject Teaching Credential from SJSU, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a 4.0 GPA. I have always been a reliable, trustworthy, and exceptional worker. Children have been my passion from the start, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than knowing I can be a part of their social and academic growth. For almost 2 years I enjoyed substitute teaching in K-5th grades, which was a great way to gather effective management skills that reinforce positive behavior. I take great pride in changing children's poor choices that have caused problems in school and at home (e.g. poor listening, difficulty following directions, lack of self-control, or needing improved social interaction skills). My consistent behavior charts encouraging self-awareness and ownership of one's actions have worked wonders in motivating children to succeed by rewarding good choices and outlining consequences for bad choices. </font></p></td>

 It's so gratifying to watch their self-confidence soar as they meet their goals, and develop in ways they never thought were possible with a can-do attitude!  I feel that I possess a special gift in bringing out the best in children and inspiring them to reach their full potential.    <br>
<br>
I am looking for a weekday position that would be approximately 30-40 hours/week near the Sunnyvale area.  Sadly, my nanny/private tutor job with 5 year old twins has just ended since the family can no longer afford a nanny.  But they are an excellent reference and will tell you how much of a positive difference I made with the quality of care I brought every day.  As a teacher, I have shelves of educational resources that I've collected through the years, and I'm always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to teach concepts.  When I teach lessons to children, I enjoy incorporating my natural talents and abilities in singing, piano playing, arts/crafts, animal training, gardening, and scrapbooking.  Families often describe me as a nurturing, wholesome, structured, consistent, and patient person.  I feel my purpose in life is to be the best role model I can for children so they can gain the life skills to become happy, successful members of society.  <br>
<br>
More About Me:<br>
<br>
1.	27 year old healthy, active female who loves the outdoors<br>
2.	Fingerprint Clearance through the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing<br>
3.	Updated Negative TB Test<br>
4.	Certification on Adult, Child, and Infant CPR<br>
5.                  Genuine and insightful teacher/nanny DVD portfolio - showcasing my ability to teach and connect with a wide range of learners <br>
6.	Clean, safe driving record (If driving is involved, I would prefer to use the family car since my car is older, but still in good condition) <br>
7.	Able to do light housework (e.g. dishes, laundry, and tidy up things), cook nutritious meals, and make life more manageable when you come home! :)<br>
<br>

<br>
I am excited to use my strong educational background and long-time nanny experiences with infants and small children to become a part of another wonderful family. In 2009 I earned my Multiple Subject Teaching Credential from SJSU, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a 4.0 GPA. I have always been a reliable, trustworthy, and exceptional worker. Children have been my passion from the start, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than knowing I can be a part of their social and academic growth. For almost 2 years I enjoyed substitute teaching in K-5th grades, which was a great way to gather effective management skills that reinforce positive behavior. I take great pride in changing children's poor choices that have caused problems in school and at home (e.g. poor listening, difficulty following directions, lack of self-control, or needing improved social interaction skills). My consistent behavior charts encouraging self-awareness and ownership of one's actions have worked wonders in motivating children to succeed by rewarding good choices and outlining consequences for bad choices. </font></p></td>

 It's so gratifying to watch their self-confidence soar as they meet their goals, and develop in ways they never thought were possible with a can-do attitude!  I feel that I possess a special gift in bringing out the best in children and inspiring them to reach their full potential.    <br>
<br>
I am looking for a weekday position that would be approximately 30-40 hours/week near the Sunnyvale area.  Sadly, my nanny/private tutor job with 5 year old twins has just ended since the family can no longer afford a nanny.  But they are an excellent reference and will tell you how much of a positive difference I made with the quality of care I brought every day.  As a teacher, I have shelves of educational resources that I've collected through the years, and I'm always on the hunt for new and exciting ways to teach concepts.  When I teach lessons to children, I enjoy incorporating my natural talents and abilities in singing, piano playing, arts/crafts, animal training, gardening, and scrapbooking.  Families often describe me as a nurturing, wholesome, structured, consistent, and patient person.  I feel my purpose in life is to be the best role model I can for children so they can gain the life skills to become happy, successful members of society.  <br>
<br>
More About Me:<br>
<br>
1.	27 year old healthy, active female who loves the outdoors<br>
2.	Fingerprint Clearance through the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing<br>
3.	Updated Negative TB Test<br>
4.	Certification on Adult, Child, and Infant CPR<br>
5.                  Genuine and insightful teacher/nanny DVD portfolio - showcasing my ability to teach and connect with a wide range of learners <br>
6.	Clean, safe driving record (If driving is involved, I would prefer to use the family car since my car is older, but still in good condition) <br>
7.	Able to do light housework (e.g. dishes, laundry, and tidy up things), cook nutritious meals, and make life more manageable when you come home! :)<br>
<br>

Our highly qualified, experienced, and loving nanny is available! <br>
<br>
 Christine has watched our school-aged children for over a year for occasional date night, overnight and/or weekend sitting. She has also house-sat for us for extended periods of time. In all cases, we have found her to be reliable and an asset to our family. Christine is always engaged with our children and willing to get down on their level to play with them in whatever their chosen activity; whether it be playing tennis, reading them stories, creating art, or simply playing with their toys. She also offers her own suggestions for adventures and entertainment to keep them busy and happy. My children are always so excited to hear that Christine is coming over. She has a BA in Psychology and has years of experience as a nanny (including shares and multiple children)<br>

As you all know, the holidays are coming up soon and there are lots of things that need to be done! Need a babysitter while you go Christmas shopping? Too many things to do and not enough time to decorate your house for Christmas? Tired from work and need someone to walk your  dog? Or maybe you have a party coming up and need the house cleaned? Maybe your child is having trouble in a subject in school and can use some extra help?  I'm your girl! I am available M-F from 1:30pm to 9:00pm and weekends from 8:00am to 9:00pm. I can provide child care; I have four years experience as I volunteered at Camp San Jose at Milbrooke community center, and am planning on getting my CPR certification very soon. I can clean, whether you need a simple fix up, or an all day deep clean, I can help with that as well. I am very crafty and like decorating, so I would love to help put up some lights on your house, and fix up the yard (raking, mowing, weed picking). I can also walk dogs around the neighborhood to get some exercise. I can also cook, so if I were to be babysitting for a long period of time, I can provide snacks and meals.

As you all know, the holidays are coming up soon and there are lots of things that need to be done! Need a babysitter while you go Christmas shopping? Too many things to do and not enough time to decorate your house for Christmas? Tired from work and need someone to walk your  dog? Or maybe you have a party coming up and need the house cleaned? Maybe your child is having trouble in a subject in school and can use some extra help?  I'm your girl! I am available M-F from 1:30pm to 9:00pm and weekends from 8:00am to 9:00pm. I can provide child care; I have four years experience as I volunteered at Camp San Jose at Milbrooke community center, and am planning on getting my CPR certification very soon. I can clean, whether you need a simple fix up, or an all day deep clean, I can help with that as well. I am very crafty and like decorating, so I would love to help put up some lights on your house, and fix up the yard (raking, mowing, weed picking). I can also walk dogs around the neighborhood to get some exercise. I can also cook, so if I were to be babysitting for a long period of time, I can provide snacks and meals. Other than that, I can help with any other household chores that need to be done!<br>

Need affordable, reliable, energetic, upbeat, legal help with 3 girls: toddler & newborn twins in Hamilton area.<br>

You: Sharp, energetic, reliable, honest, punctual, happy, loving, experienced team-player willing and able to take direction without attitude and pitch-in with what needs to be done (maybe a little laundry, cooking, dishes/cleaning, etc). Excited about working with little cutie-pies - especially the toddler - and helping get a family back on it's feet after the tornado called twins hit our life. Current vaccinations and clean driving/police record. English fluent.<br>
<br>
Us: youngish, moderately progressive creative-types (i.e. a little quirky) with big hearts and suddenly more kids than hands or hours<br>
<br>
Schedule relatively flexible. Could work out to be almost full-time but filled out over a week, rather than concentrated during business hours. This may work out to be 1 person or 2. <br>
<br>
$9-12+/hr DOE. Perhaps weekly or monthly salary? Or maybe live-in with living stipend? We don't exactly know but trying to figure it out.<br>
<br>
*** Don't know the best place to place this ad - in domestic gigs or here in childcare. Very unclear.  PLEASE, do not flag it. It is a legitimate opportunity for earnest & needing family just trying to reach the right people (maybe you?) and not knowing where those eyes will be. Thank you.

Are you looking for a one on one situation for your child?  Are you seeking an alternative choice to large group care?  Is the expense of a personal Nanny too much?  I'm pleased to be  availing an alternative option.  I am a stay at home mom of a teen and have operated a  licensed day care for 31+ years.  I'm now in the position to  provide exceptional care to one special child!   Vast child care experience, with an emphasis on infants and toddlers.  Full time or part time schedules acceptable.  Flexibility paired with dependability!  I am C.P.R. and First Aid certified.  T.B. tested negative.   VERY clean and safe new home located in a natural, serene and central location of Novato.  Beautiful large fenced yard.  Close to both Hwy. 101 and Hwy. 37.    Wonderful references available upon request.  I'm seeking a family to work with that shares similar values and is interested in obtaining professional, top quality care for their child.  Thank you and I look forward to the opportunity of speaking with you if this may be a good match for your needs!    895-5080  or  847-3060

Hi-<br>
I currently have a Monday-Wednesday- Friday spot available in my home based child care for a child between 24 and 36 months of age. I also have a Monday through Friday spot opening up in January.  I have been caring for toddlers in my home since 1994 and was employed at St Joseph Mercy Hospital's employer sponsored center in Ann Arbor, MI for 8 years previous to that-adding up to 26 years of professional experience with this age group.   My hours of availability are from 9:00 until 5:30 Monday through Thursday and 9:00 until 4:30 on Fridays.    If you would like more information and would like to schedule a visit please drop me a line.  My house is well equipped with a plethora of age appropriate playthings, books and art materials as well as two friendly and exceptionally tolerant cats.  Kids have fun and feel safe and secure in my care.<br>
Thank you for your interest.<br>

Waldorf-inspired Nanny available to care for infants through school aged children.<br>
<br>
My experience with Steiner's philosophy has always been positive. I decided as many nannies declare their ethnicity in the title of their ad, I wanted to see if there were any wonderful Waldorf families that needed childcare! <br>
<br>
I have experience assisting in a Waldorf based preschool in Upstate New York. From my experience of visiting certified Steiner schools, the program I assisted was very similar. We really only threw a little yoga in there for the 4 year olds :) <br>
I enjoyed the painting style, the natural fibers and materials, the healthy meals, the ritual of eating together, the puppet shows/dress up, the birthday circle and the appreciation for the outdoors. <br>
<br>
I would be more then happy to send you my entire resume and experience once you email.<br>
