Known as the "grandfather of specialty coffee," Peet's Coffee & Tea has been a Berkeley institution since opening its doors more than forty years ago. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Peet's Coffee & Tea was a pioneer among other food purveyors in Berkeley's "gourmet ghetto" - a collection of European style shops and restaurants. Today, traditional values are maintained through the hard work and attention to detail that is essential to creating coffees of distinction. The roasting facility is in Alameda, just a few miles from the original location on Vine Street in Berkeley, which still attracts a large, loyal following, including many who are proud that they have been customers since the store opened in 1966. 

<br><br>

Peet's Coffee & Tea is hiring <b>Retail Associates and Shift Leads</b> for our <b>San Jose area stores</b>!  We are seeking candidates with a passion for quality and customer service.  Open availability (including early mornings, evenings, and Saturdays/Sundays) preferred. Shift lead candidates must have 1 to 2 years of supervisory experience in a retail environment. <br><br> 
<b>Please attend the following JOB FAIR and meet with the Peet's management team for an on-site interview!
<br><br>

Tuesday, December 6th<br>
11:00 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
Peet's Willow Glen<br>
1140 Lincoln Avenue, San Jose</b>
<br><br>
Visit our website to download and print an application: www.peets.com/careers
<br><br>
<b>If you are unable to attend the job fair, please apply directly at one of the following Peet's locations:
<br><br>
 Peet's Willow Glen: 1140 Lincoln Avenue, San Jose 
 Peet's El Paseo: 1330 El Paseo De Saratoga, San Jose
 Peet's Santana Row: 377 Sanatana Row, Suite #1130, San Jose
 Peet's DT San Jose: 66 W. Santa Clara Street, San Jose</b>
<br><br>

<b>What you will do as a Retail Associate:</b>
<br>
Provide customers with extraordinary customer service. Whether it's setting up a coffee tasting or steaming non-fat milk instead of whole milk, we encourage you to make the most of your customer's experience. Share your passion for coffee and tea with our customers. Make the best coffee, tea and espresso drinks. Take pride in the way the store looks-sweep the floors, dust the merchandise, clean the windows. It may not be glamorous but there is always something to do. 
<br><br>

<b>What you will do as a Shift Lead: </b>
<br>
The Shift Lead, under the direction of the Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager, fulfills the responsibilities and activities of the Retail Associate with the technical and supervisory skills necessary to successfully close and/or open the store. These skills include the ability to analyze and complete daily financial books, to maintain cash and store security, and to reinforce teamwork and store harmony through excellent communication skills. The Shift Lead is a role model and a resource for other employees. In the absence of a Store Manager or Assistant, the Shift Lead may problem-solve and make business decisions with the guidance and support of other managers in the region as well as the District Manager. 
<br><br>

<b>What you will get as a Retail Associate or Shift Lead: </b>
<br>
In return for all of this, you will get great benefits (including medical, dental, prescription, vision, 401(k) plan), a respectful work environment, excellent training, a sense of accomplishment, advancement opportunities and the breadth and depth of coffee and tea knowledge from the gold standard specialty coffee company. 
<br><br>
We encourage applicants of all ages, races and ethnic backgrounds.

<b>Please attend the following JOB FAIR and meet with the Peet's management team for an on-site interview!
<br><br>

Tuesday, December 6th<br>
11:00 AM - 1:00 PM<br>
Peet's Willow Glen<br>
1140 Lincoln Avenue, San Jose</b>
<br><br>
Visit our website to download and print an application: www.peets.com/careers
<br><br>
<b>If you are unable to attend the job fair, please apply directly at one of the following Peet's locations:
<br><br>
 Peet's Willow Glen: 1140 Lincoln Avenue, San Jose 
 Peet's El Paseo: 1330 El Paseo De Saratoga, San Jose
 Peet's Santana Row: 377 Sanatana Row, Suite #1130, San Jose
 Peet's DT San Jose: 66 W. Santa Clara Street, San Jose</b>
<br><br>

<b>What you will do as a Retail Associate:</b>
<br>
Provide customers with extraordinary customer service. Whether it's setting up a coffee tasting or steaming non-fat milk instead of whole milk, we encourage you to make the most of your customer's experience. Share your passion for coffee and tea with our customers. Make the best coffee, tea and espresso drinks. Take pride in the way the store looks-sweep the floors, dust the merchandise, clean the windows. It may not be glamorous but there is always something to do. 
<br><br>

<b>What you will do as a Shift Lead: </b>
<br>
The Shift Lead, under the direction of the Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager, fulfills the responsibilities and activities of the Retail Associate with the technical and supervisory skills necessary to successfully close and/or open the store. These skills include the ability to analyze and complete daily financial books, to maintain cash and store security, and to reinforce teamwork and store harmony through excellent communication skills. The Shift Lead is a role model and a resource for other employees. In the absence of a Store Manager or Assistant, the Shift Lead may problem-solve and make business decisions with the guidance and support of other managers in the region as well as the District Manager. 
<br><br>

<b>What you will get as a Retail Associate or Shift Lead: </b>
<br>
In return for all of this, you will get great benefits (including medical, dental, prescription, vision, 401(k) plan), a respectful work environment, excellent training, a sense of accomplishment, advancement opportunities and the breadth and depth of coffee and tea knowledge from the gold standard specialty coffee company. 
<br><br>
We encourage applicants of all ages, races and ethnic backgrounds.
