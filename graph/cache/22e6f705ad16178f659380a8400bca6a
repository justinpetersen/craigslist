"I studied with Mark for 5 years, while not a full time musician I became a working paid player who has been on many cd's, etc. Mark is extremely patient and non-judgemental, he is up-beat and works with you from where you are, beginner on up. He also knows his stuff extremely well."<br><br>
"Mark is the best! He is a wonderful teacher, extremely patient and works at whatever level and speed each student desires. I find him insanely funny, which helps when I'm trying to weasel my way through the fact that I haven't practiced each week :) I have learned more theory from Mark playing guitar than I did in my 10+ years of classical piano playing. I enjoy our group lessons the best, where we learn how to play with other people and have the opportunity to improvise."<br><br>

If you are a beginner looking to start with a great set of fundamentals that you can then use to improve on your own or an experienced player looking to improve specific strokes, Classic Strokes Tennis Instruction can give you great basic skills and fundamentals for reaching your potential.<br>
<br>
Our overall focus is on a very effective playing approach for recreational players that need reliable and consistent strokes for anytime they step on a court.  Emphasizing consistent footwork and balance will immediately improve all of your shots.  Showing you a more consistent stroke path and correct racquet angles will also immediately add both power, accuracy, and control.  Your serves will also usually add both power and control very quickly by focusing on both balance and using the major muscle groups of your upper body to control your serve instead of using lots of extra movement with your arms and hands.<br>
<br>
Strokes and shots that often seem more difficult will be easily mastered with our straightforward approach.  Inconsistent backhand strokes are immediately improved with a more consistent stroke path and better balance.  If you have ever wanted to try a one-handed backhand, most clients take only one lesson to effectively learn how to consistently hit a one-handed backhand (and about 75 percent of my women clients have learned how to use a one-handed backhand).  If you have ever wondered why so many forehands fly long over the baseline, in only ten or fifteen minutes you will learn how to consistently use topspin resulting in your forehand now dipping into the court.  If your volleys are inconsistent, some basic footwork drills and improved racquet positioning will significantly improve both your range and consistency on volleys.<br>
<br>
For more information, please also visit our website at www.classicstrokes.com.  Some other basic information, however, is that I teach on a very convenient (and newly resurfaced!) private court located near the Civic Center and I also attempt to keep my rates affordable for almost all budgets.  Individual lessons are $45 per hour and there are also two lesson packages available which are either four lessons for $160 or ten lessons for $350.

<br>
I specialize in preparing students for the math portion of standardized tests like the SSAT and ISEE, as well as the SAT, ACT, and PSAT. There are certain kinds of problems on these tests that appear repeatedly. I get students accustomed to these questions, and teach them how to solve them quickly. My students' scores have risen dramatically. <br>
<br>
I am extremely devoted to my students. My personal mission is not only to help students improve their test scores, but to develop healthy study habits, improve their self esteem, and feel good about learning. At first, the student completes a diagnostic test that will show us what areas need to be worked on. I then create a customized curriculum that will not only address their weaknesses, but familiarize them with test-taking strategies. Parents are given written or verbal status reports after every third session. <br>
<br>
I understand that parents worry about their children's future, especially their ability to get into a desirable college. I know the stakes are high, and I take my job very seriously. Parents become less anxious after I start working with their child. They are relieved, as they see their child's confidence and test scores steadily rise. <br>
<br>
Students respond well to my teaching style. My friendly, conversational, and nonjudgemental demeanor puts them at ease. They feel comfortable asking questions, and aren't afraid to admit that they don't understand something. At the same time, I set high standards - knowing when, and how much to push them. The results are dramatically positive. <br>

This is what clients have written about me: <br>
<br>
-Dan, May 2009 <br>
<br>
"Sharon has a special gift for teaching and an incredible rapport that she maintains with both the students and the parents. I've worked with many tutors during my daughter's last 10 years of schooling and Sharon is in a class of her own. She radiates incredible energy and enthusiasm for the subject matters and yet maintains a friendly conversational style which is completely unthreatening to students. From my perspective what is important in a tutor is finding a person that can bring the best energy out in my particular child. Sharon has proven her ability to do this over and over again and when she leaves the house [my daughter,] instead of being tired and fatigued, is energized to finish the project at hand." <br>
<br>
-Keat, June 2009 <br>
<br>
"[My daughter] was having difficulty in Algebra grasping some of the concepts. We met with her once a week and her improvement in Algebra has been remarkable. Her teacher went out of her way to call home and express how [my daughter] was showing great improvement in her class and wanted to congratulate her. <br>
<br>
[My daughter] is somewhat of a shy kid who was not able to get the one on one attention she needed at school. Sharon's tutoring gave her the individual attention she need to excel in Algebra. She went from C's to A's on her tests. [My daughter] finds school overall more enjoyable and less stressful since. <br>
<br>
We are pleased with Sharon and plan on continually utilizing her services for our daughter as her math curriculum continues to intensify. I would recommend her to any student looking to improve in mathematics." <br>
<br>
- [Name Witheld], July 2009 <br>
<br>
"My daughter says that Sharon is a great tutor because she: can explain concepts in multiple ways, asks the student to explain/teach concepts back to insure understanding, is always patient, makes sure that concepts already learned are retained in order to solve more complicated problems. Sharon is very conscientious and serious tutor. She helped my daughter develop some confidence to solve math problems. As a result, my daughter improved on her tests by receiving a greater percentage of correct answers and successfully completed this class." <br>
<br>
- Jewli, February 2009 <br>
<br>
"Sharon Roh has been tutoring my son...His grade in Algebra went from a D to a B." <br>
<br>
-Chang, Sept 2008 <br>
<br>
"...We wanted our daughter to be prepared for high school Algebra I and Spanish I. Sharon was very helpful in my daughter gaining confidence in the subjects. She was able to identify the problem areas that my daughter was having after a couple of meetings and tried to fix the problem. Sharon is a very punctual person and seemed to be well prepared. We strongly recommend her as a tutor." <br>
<br>
Other clients: <br>
<br>
"...we have found Sharon's ability to determine the crux of certain problems very insightful and intuitive. She applies a variety of teaching techniques to solve learning style differences. She has attained a certain trust that comes with a good working relationship, and [my son] has found each session to be helpful - 100% of the time." <br>
<br>
"Her perseverance and consistency in uncovering [my son's] academic weaknesses, has made all the difference in determining a course of action for his improvement. Using the grading system as a measuring tool, there have been measurable differences in [my son's] performance." <br>
<br>
"She is helping [my son] with Algebra. He has made tremendous progress lifting his grades from Ds and Cs to Bs. He is enthusiastic about her assistance. He finds her explanations clear and exceptionally helpful." <br>
<br>
"Sharon has been very responsible in keeping me informed and suggesting approaches to improving his performance. I feel very lucky to have met her and strongly recommend her." <br>
<br>
"Sharon's professionalism throughout the year has insured our staying on top of [my son's] progress. Her flexibility has enabled us to change times of tutoring sessions to meet changing high school sport schedules. In addition, she was consistently good-natured throughout this endeavor." <br>

Teaching Methodology<br>
I help students develop self-confidence and learn how to find solutions to problems in their own way. <br>
<br>
Your child needs to develop a powerful set of tools for study skills and time management habits. Only after they have worked out problems for themselves do I provide corrections if needed. <br>
<br>
If an answer is wrong, I will show them where they went wrong and how to do the problem correctly. Or, if some of the fundamentals of the subject are missing, I will set aside time to cover important areas in your student's required curriculum.<br>
 <br>
I am available during the school year and summer to work with you and your Middle School, High School, or College Student, age 11 years to Adult. Private 1 on 1 In-Home Tutoring and Homework Help is the proven best way to get the results you are seeking for your child.<br>
<br>
Call today and let me know how I can help you.  We will discuss your current situation and develop an appropriate lesson plan.<br>

Professional Credentials<br>
Before I began my career as an educator, I received my Electrical and Computer Engineering degree at the University of California, Santa Barbara, prior to which I studied Psychology and Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
After working for 20 years as an Electrical and Software Engineer, I am now a full-time private tutor with a business license in Mountain View, California. I am a credentialed substitute teacher and have taught at Middle Schools and High Schools in the Cupertino, Los Altos, Palo Alto, Fremont Union, Mountain View, and Sequoia school districts.<br>
<br>
<br>
My Background<br>
Since 2003 I have been helping Middle School, High School, and College Students achieve better results in Math, Essay Writing, Standardized Test Preparation, and other subjects.<br>
<br>
I have been helping people of all ages (11 years to adult) develop greater self-confidence, study more effectively, and excel academically. I am continually looking for positive incentives that will inspire my students to work with a sense of purpose toward attainable goals.<br>
<br>
I have found that some students are self-motivated while others need more guidance and personal attention, and still others just need the support of a private tutor to keep them on track. I have worked with many personality types and I am available to discuss different ways to help you with your child's individual needs. With proper focus and sustained effort your teen or college student will learn how to develop better study habits, get better grades, and make better decisions about his or her academic studies and professional career.<br>

Dear student, parent of student, or teacher:<br>
<br>
I am a recent UC graduate with a tutoring clientele ranging from Junior High through High School. As an International Baccalaureate student, I have extensive experience with AP/IB courses and testing, SAT prep, and college application essays. I also have a strong background in mathematics, chemistry and biology as my B.S. is in Biological Sciences. I offer in-home sessions tailored to each student's learning styles and specific needs, assistance in time management, as well as connecting with the students and offering a demonstration of how an organized lifestyle benefits one overall. <br>
<br>
I schedule one-on-one appointments at the rate of $40/hour, and offer group discounts if multiple students wish to meet together.<br>
<br>
Please call or email me to further discuss your student's needs and to set an appointment.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

I'm a Math major that enjoys teaching and can teach anyone who wants to learn. I teach pre-Algebra through Calculus and beyond, as well as Geometry, Number Theory, Math appreciation, plus can help improve scores on tests like the SAT, GRE, and GMAT. I have over 7 years experience in Math tutoring and I regularly do voluntary tutoring too.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am obviously good at Math but I think what makes me a good tutor (as opposed to just a good mathematician) is my ability to connect with the pupil and put everything in a clear and understandable form. I am very patient and I have found that this helps maybe more than anything else, especially when the pupil loses heart. I will take a personal interest in helping whoever needs help and making it happen with a surprisingly small amount of stress.<br>

I can help with all phases of research paper writing: theme development, organization, logic flow, grammar, sentence structure, format, and documentation. I have a B.A. in Political Science and an M.P.A. in Public Administration from California State University, East Bay. I have written many research papers including a Master's thesis. I am a retired stockbroker who started a tutoring business two years ago. I recently helped a business major at University of Phoenix to raise her grade point average from 2.9 to 3.2 in a little over a year. She has since graduated. Trust me; you will still need your writing skills after you graduate. You will not impress your boss and co-workers by sending poorly written emails at work and it will limit your career. My rate is $30 an hour with a 1 ½ hour minimum. I can be reached at 408-286-9044.

<big><b>Lessons in Indian Tabla</b>

<p>Lessons in classical North Indian tabla, folk styles or tabla as a general percussion instrument, according to your interests. 
My teaching style emphasizes rhythm, tone and musicality. This allows for a rewarding experience of your instrument even as a beginner. 
More advanced students will find that my unique approach can open new ways of understanding and feeling rhythm.

<p>I began studying tabla in 1995 and am currently studying under tabla master Swapan Chaudhuri.

<p>I have been teaching for many years and have experience with all types of students. Beginners, 'non-musicians', children and adults are all welcome. 

<p>Lessons are at my house in the North Berkeley Hills. Scheduling is flexible according to your needs.

<p>For more information or to schedule a lesson contact David Aue at:  510-541-8988   or   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/mailto:tabla@aue.org?subject=Tabla%20Lessons">tabla@aue.org</a>

Want to learn guitar as effectively (quickly) as possible and in a supportive and friendly enviornment with a trained and experienced teacher who specializes in kid's and new learners? (Intermediate and Advanced players welcome too). Then email me! I have been teaching and playing for 20 years and have developed a very basic but effective method of learning how to play guitar, especially rock - classic, punk, metal, blues...... <br>
I have a Performing Arts degree in Music and I have studied at the Musicians Institute (MI) Guitar Institute of Technology (GIT).  MI was itself founded around the simple goal of professionally training guitarists in a quicker, more efficient and appropriate way for today's player (instead of the traditional classical Conservatory approach).  The school has trained a who's who of rock stars - John Frusciante from the Chilli Peppers, Jeff Buckley, Avenged Sevenfold, Buckethead...... I also have a BA from UC-Berkeley in communication / rhetoric am now pursuing my MA. <br>
<br>
I have studied with some of the world's top players and a few bona fide rock stars and legends.  Robert Fripp of King Crimson, Dave Dipietro of TTQuick, Kenny Dubman of Prophet, Eddie Ojeda of Twisted Sister and Jack Starr of Burning Starr and Virgin Steele.  I have met and spoken with Les Paul, BB King, Albert King, Yngwie Malmsteen, Alan Holdsworth, Steve Morse, Paul Gilbert, Zakk Wylde and other world class players about guitar playing and learning. <br>
<br>
I teach kids and adults and can provide references of course.  I can also help with acquiring inexpensive quality instruments. I teach here in my home studio in Alameda. <br>
$25 for a half hour lesson. <br>

Hi!! My name is Lili, I' m 26, from France. I ve got a master in business law.I m highly educated, fluent in English ( Academic IELTS : 7 ) and I am sure I can help students to improve their French. I think having a native French speaker, as a tutor is essential to ameliorate your reading, spelling, grammar, and pronunciation. &#8232;&#8232;I think communication is essential between myself and the student, thus, I will ask first what you want in order to structure my lesson plan according to your abilities, goals and budget. &#8232;<br>
<br>
&#8232;To improve a language it is very important to practice it. I will do my best to encourage you to speak and understand French, I will be an interactive teacher and I will make my lessons fun and interesting. I offer lessons to both children and adults. <br>
<br>
 I m available at any time. &#8232;Send me an email if you are interested ! &#8232;A bientot!&#8232;&#8232;<br>
<br>
Experience : &#8232;When I was going for my masters at university in France, I was a tutor and helped students with law studies. I also lived in Australia for a year and I had the opportunity to be a French teacher for a Community Center, where I was a French tutor for 10 students (from beginners to advanced)<br>

Ciao!!!!<br>
<br>
My name is Dario, I am a native Italian and I am offering private lessons to both individual and groups.<br>
<br>
I have been teaching Italian for more than 6 years, to individuals and groups, I like to create the lesson around the need of my clients.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For beginners: I always recommend to start with a good book, the one I use at the moment is Prego (6th edition) so that you can start to build brick by brick the foundation of a solid language that will stay with you forever. I will guide you through the book helping you to easily understand it, we will do exercises, lots of exciting and fun practices, and I will also help you to memorize many Italian words in a fun and relaxed way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For intermediate/advanced: Conversation will be the main key in the lesson. I will teach you ways to say things in Italian that only natives know, idioms, proverbs, accents, typical gestures, etc.. We will create situations in which we will with our imagination go to Italy and we will reproduce usual moments and situations (like, shopping, buying tickets, renting a place, going to a restaurant, meeting with friends, etc.).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For private lessons: We will meet at a cafe in Piedmont Ave , Oakland or on Skype and like two Italian friends we will chat and in a relaxed atmosphere you will easily learn this beautiful language.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For groups: We will meet at a cafe or at your place if you prefer, and we will use the group to practice numerous life situations, bigger the group more will be the opportunity to practice with different people. All this practice will help you immensely and the group will support you in the difficult moments and boost you to get better and better. When I usually teach to groups we always have a lot of fun, and I noticed that to be a really important key in the process of learning.<br>
 <br>
<br>
About me: I am from Naples , the city of pizza and pasta, excessive gesturing and much more, but even if we, Southern people, are the most difficult to understand when we speak, my Italian is clear and I do my best effort to speak slowly and I don?t mind to repeat myself many times.<br>
<br>
I believe people learn more when they learn in a non-judgmental, fun and joyful environment, but also with a steady guidance and with a clear goal in their minds.<br>
<br>
Feel free to email me at my craigslist email for more information or you can also call me at 510-3334438<br>
<br>
Looking forward to meeting you<br>
<br>
Ciao, a presto<br>
<br>
Dario

Why CrossFit?  RESULTS. PERIOD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What's the CrossFit Difference?<br>
<br>
In gyms and health clubs throughout the world the typical workout consists of isolation movements and extended aerobic sessions. The fitness community from trainers to the magazines has the exercising public believing that lateral raises, curls, leg extensions, sit-ups and the like combined with 20-40 minute stints on the stationary bike or treadmill are going to lead to some kind of great fitness. Well, at CrossFit we work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high intensity cardiovascular sessions. We've replaced the lateral raise with push-press, the curl with pull-ups, the leg extension with squats, and the mirrors with bumper plates.<br>
<br>
Why? Because compound or functional movements at high intensity or anaerobic cardio is radically more effective at eliciting nearly any desired fitness result. Startlingly, this is not a matter of opinion but solid irrefutable scientific fact and yet the marginally effective old ways persist and are nearly universal. Our approach is consistent with what is practiced in elite training programs associated with major university athletic teams and professional sports. CrossFit endeavors to bring state-of-the-art coaching techniques to the general public and student athlete.<br>

Just moved here a little over a 3 weeks ago and looking forward to meeting new students and families.  Call (650) 208-0892 or email for more info, availabilty, or to arrange a trial lesson/meeting ($10).  Thank you.  -  Simon

If you're preparing to take the LSAT, whether you're just getting started 
<br>
or you've been at it for a while, I can help.  
<br>
<br>
In my fifteen years  as an LSAT class instructor and tutor, I've worked
<br>
with college students and recent graduates who are comfortable with
<br>
standardized testing, and with returning students who are not.  I've helped
<br>
high-scoring individuals hone their skills for a few extra points, and guided
<br>
folks who need to start with the basics.  No single approach works equally
<br>
well for everyone, and a tutoring relationship affords the flexibility to tailor
<br>
a study plan to your particular needs.  I'm a friendly guy who will work with 
<br>
you to find the approach that benefits you the most.
<br>
<br>
I can provide a structured study plan, or work in tandem with any test prep
<br>
company's course.  The only necessary study materials are actual past LSATs.
<br>
I've studied them all, and there aren't any tricks that they may pull that I won't
<br>
see coming; I can teach you to see them, too.  Beyond that, any books or
<br>
materials that you have from the bookstore or a prep course that you've found
<br>
useful can be incorporated, and I'd be happy to evaluate any that you're considering.
<br>
<br>
We can meet anywhere convenient to you in San Francisco, Berkeley, or Oakland:
<br>
your home or office, a library or bookstore, or a cafe.  Clients typically choose
<br>
to meet one or twice per week, for two or three-hour sessions; you can set
<br>
whatever schedule you'd like.
<br>
<br>
A one-hour introductory meeting is free, so that you can decide whether we'd work
<br>
well together.  Thereafter, sessions are $40 per hour, plus a $10 session fee.

If you're preparing to take the LSAT, whether you're just getting started 
<br>
or you've been at it for a while, I can help.  
<br>
<br>
In my fifteen years  as an LSAT class instructor and tutor, I've worked
<br>
with college students and recent graduates who are comfortable with
<br>
standardized testing, and with returning students who are not.  I've helped
<br>
high-scoring individuals hone their skills for a few extra points, and guided
<br>
folks who need to start with the basics.  No single approach works equally
<br>
well for everyone, and a tutoring relationship affords the flexibility to tailor
<br>
a study plan to your particular needs.  I'm a friendly guy who will work with 
<br>
you to find the approach that benefits you the most.
<br>
<br>
I can provide a structured study plan, or work in tandem with any test prep
<br>
company's course.  The only necessary study materials are actual past LSATs.
<br>
I've studied them all, and there aren't any tricks that they may pull that I won't
<br>
see coming; I can teach you to see them, too.  Beyond that, any books or
<br>
materials that you have from the bookstore or a prep course that you've found
<br>
useful can be incorporated, and I'd be happy to evaluate any that you're considering.
<br>
<br>
We can meet anywhere convenient to you in San Francisco, Berkeley, or Oakland:
<br>
your home or office, a library or bookstore, or a cafe.  Clients typically choose
<br>

I teach guitar, bass, piano, clarinet, flute, composition and theory to students of all ages. <br>
<br>
I have been teaching for several years, and have worked with absolute beginners (ages 4-60) and intermediate and advanced students. My degree is in composition, but I can help you explore any aspects of musical performance, technique, theory, or composition you might be interested in. <br>

I have been teaching for several years, and have worked with students of all ages (4-30) in everything from basic arithmetic through multivariable calculus and linear algebra. I have had considerable success helping students figure out precisely what it is that they don't understand, and then finding a way to explain it that makes sense to each individual. <br>
<br>
While I consider my rate to be quite fair ($30/hr), in the event that you need a tutor but simply cannot afford one, contact me and we'll try and work something out. <br>

<h2>
	People are our most valuable resource.</h2>
<h3>
	Supercharge your company&#39;s people skills so your people drive the organization forward, instead of having to be prodded along</h3>
<p>
	It&#39;s not unusual to see huge expenditures of capital on fancy equipment. When new equipment is bought, it is considered an asset. It is valued and maintained, although everyone knows it will eventually depreciate and break down. It will never perform better than the day it was bought. On the other hand, many organizations consider salaries a liability. Payrolls often constitute the largest variable expenditure in a company&#39;s balance sheet. The people who keep the business moving often feel the resentment of their employers and bear the brunt of this purely financial definition of their roles. A lot of salaried workers haven&#39;t had as much attention as the equipment they use, although it is they, not their machines, who have the potential to perform better. Does it make sense to focus more on the equipment people use than the people who use it? What if we revised our thinking about human capital and considered salaries to be investments in people&#39;s potential rather than expenditures? Our employees and coworkers then become assets rather than liabilities. More importantly for your bottom line, you then have the opportunity to inspire more and more out of your human capital.</p>
<h3>
	People are your most valuable resource. It pays to invest in people.</h3>
<h3>
	Call to have a PhD qualified communication expert conduct a free, professional, no obligation assessment of your current human capital training needs.</h3>

<h2>
	People are our most valuable resource.</h2>
<h3>
	Supercharge your company&#39;s people skills so your people drive the organization forward, instead of having to be prodded along</h3>
<p>
	It&#39;s not unusual to see huge expenditures of capital on fancy equipment. When new equipment is bought, it is considered an asset. It is valued and maintained, although everyone knows it will eventually depreciate and break down. It will never perform better than the day it was bought. On the other hand, many organizations consider salaries a liability. Payrolls often constitute the largest variable expenditure in a company&#39;s balance sheet. The people who keep the business moving often feel the resentment of their employers and bear the brunt of this purely financial definition of their roles. A lot of salaried workers haven&#39;t had as much attention as the equipment they use, although it is they, not their machines, who have the potential to perform better. Does it make sense to focus more on the equipment people use than the people who use it? What if we revised our thinking about human capital and considered salaries to be investments in people&#39;s potential rather than expenditures? Our employees and coworkers then become assets rather than liabilities. More importantly for your bottom line, you then have the opportunity to inspire more and more out of your human capital.</p>
<h3>
	People are your most valuable resource. It pays to invest in people.</h3>
<h3>
	Call to have a PhD qualified communication expert conduct a free, professional, no obligation assessment of your current human capital training needs.</h3>

Want to learn to play the blues?  Already playing, but a little stuck and looking for a new angle?<br>
<br>
I can help, and we can have fun!<br>
<br>
My experience includes live touring and recording with folks like Dr. John, Elvin Bishop, Otis Clay, Maria Muldaur and others.<br>
<br>
Bring your favorite song and we'll learn to play it together. Blues, R&B, funk, New Orleans, roots music, or just about anything.<br>
<br>
We can work on:<br>
- basic blues progressions/chord forms<br>
- super simple theory to help with soloing within those structures, including some basic chord ear training<br>
- performing with others, including live jam environments<br>
- specific techniques for more advanced players<br>
- anything else you can think of...I'll do anything I can to help you!<br>
<br>
We can meet at a studio in Potrero Hill in San Francisco, at my place in Belmont, or your home.<br>
<br>
I can also help with gear selection.<br>
<br>
Let's make it fun!<br>

Aprender y practicar ingles con un paseo conmigo:<br>
<br>
Hola! Soy Christina. Soy fluente en ingles y hablo bastante espanol para contestar sus preguntas en espanol y ingles.<br>
<br>
Podemos communicar de muchas cosas, incluyendo negocios, su escuela y classes o los de su familia, su trabajo, su vida, cosas divertidas, y mucho mas.<br>
<br>
Tengo un titulo universitario en psicologia de Sonoma State University. Vivo en Kentfield y camino mucho en la area.<br>
<br>
En la universidad, estudie como personas aprenden, y como ellos pueden aprender mas en modos mas faciles. Puedo ayudarle como aprender en modos buenos para usted, y con menos vez. Podemos hablar de este en espanol y ingles durante las reuniones.<br>
<br>
Muchos vezes camino con mi amigo para estes cosas -- para practicar ingles (o espanol) incluyendo pronunciacion, y para aprender de las culturas. Mi espanol es castillano. El espanol de mi amigo es de Guatemala. En el pasado yo hable mucho con personas de Mexico tambien.<br>
<br>
A veces, personas aprender mas en veces breves. Cada reunion es 60 minutos o mas -- es su eleccion.<br>
<br>
A veces, personas aprender mas quando estan en movimiento. Durante los reuniones, caminamos despacios or para ejercicio. O podemos sentir, si quiere -- es su eleccion tambien.<br>
<br>
Es solamente $20.00 para 60 minutos. <br>
<br>
Podemos tener un cita en la dia, la tarde, o la fin de la semana.<br>

I offer coaching and critiques for your presentation, speech, sales meeting or performance review. These issues include: <br>
<br>
-Physical mechanics of articulation and projection <br>
-Knowing when to accent or 'hit' a word for emphasis <br>
-Learning to vary one's tone to maintain audience interest, and avoid a monotone <br>
-Helping you edit your content with regard to word choice, sentence structure and stylistic matters <br>
-Attention to voice and voice-training issues, such as awareness of the voice rising in pitch as the speaker gets nervous. <br>
<br>
We help with all that and more, whether your issue is preparing for a single presentation or improving these skills for academic or business issues. <br>
<br>
Many good writers need some coaching to become effective speakers. Lesser writers also need help with composition and word choice. <br>
<br>
My background includes media and leadership positions as a community college teacher, radio DJ, and program host for public events. I've also worked as a trainer and manager for non-profit fundraising campaigns, and written scripts for same. <br>
<br>
This service is ad adjunct of my formal program for Accent Reduction for Non-Native English Speakers: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.accentredux.com/">http://www.accentredux.com/</a><br>

I offer coaching and critiques for your presentation, speech, sales meeting or performance review. These issues include: <br>
<br>
-Physical mechanics of articulation and projection <br>
-Knowing when to accent or 'hit' a word for emphasis <br>
-Learning to vary one's tone to maintain audience interest, and avoid a monotone <br>
-Helping you edit your content with regard to word choice, sentence structure and stylistic matters <br>
-Attention to voice and voice-training issues, such as awareness of the voice rising in pitch as the speaker gets nervous. <br>
<br>
We help with all that and more, whether your issue is preparing for a single presentation or improving these skills for academic or business issues. <br>
<br>
Many good writers need some coaching to become effective speakers. Lesser writers also need help with composition and word choice. <br>
<br>
My background includes media and leadership positions as a community college teacher, radio DJ, and program host for public events. I've also worked as a trainer and manager for non-profit fundraising campaigns, and written scripts for same. <br>
<br>
This service is ad adjunct of my formal program for Accent Reduction for Non-Native English Speakers: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.accentredux.com/">http://www.accentredux.com/</a><br>

I offer a 4-6 hour evaluation and counseling process for prospective college and grad school students. My fee is $60/hr., so client can expect to budget between $240-$360 for the entire process.. This includes providing you with the outline and counsel for developing a personal essay or statement of purpose. The New York Times tells us that the average fee for pre-college counseling is $185/hr!!! They noted on Sunday, July 19, 2009 "While the going national rate for such work is about $185 an hour, a counselor in Vermont and another in New York City are among those who charge some families more than $40,000." <br>
<br>
An outside counselor for your child's college selection and application process can also preserve the peace of family dynamics! We know the counseling resources of most high schools are understaffed, and that students and families NEED more intensive attention than is available. I offer over 20 years of exerience of helping to place students in colleges and grad schools all over the country, covering the full spectrum of academia. <br>
<br>
I offer familiarity with a broad spectrum of colleges throughout California and the U.S. Some of the issues with which I can be helpful include: <br>
<br>
-Which schools should I apply to? <br>
-What should my course selection be to match my career path? <br>
-What if I decide to change my major after a year or two? <br>
-What kind of social life do I want in college? <br>
<br>
Within my service I offer: <br>
-Editorial support and counsel for your Statement of Purpose (SOP) or admissions essay. I furnish a template for getting started, if you're really stuck. <br>
-Special counsel for balancing sports and academics, including helping a prospective college athlete determine whether Division a I, II or III school is the best match for his/her abilities and skills. <br>
-Special counsel for musicians and dancers. <br>
<br>
My background includes: <br>
-B.A. w/ Honors & Distinction from Rhodes College. <br>
-M.A. from the University of Michigan. <br>
-Many years as a professional writer and editor. <br>
-College athletics in basketball and track. <br>
-Experience in dance and music. <br>
-Many years in swimming as a competitor, stroke coach, vendor and consultant. <br>
-Many success stories. <br>
<br>
I also save you money! My fees are much less than similar services offered by Kaplan and Princeton review. Unlike those services, once we start, you can call me up anytime and not be stuck with an extra fee. <br>
<br>
2 meetings gets a student on track, and then I can be available as needed for helping to upload applications or refining an essay for a particular school. Some students and families have chosen to have me more involved, but most people get what they need within the 4-6 hour timeframe. <br>
<br>
For more insight into the process, give me a call or send an e-mail with your phone number. <br>

Learn to improvise, read music, create bass lines,<br>
read chord charts, and be creative with scales and modes.<br>
Lessons will include technique, theory, improvisation and repertoire building.<br>
<br>
All levels, ages, and interests can benefit from my teaching method. <br>
My students range in age from 12 to 60 years old. <br>
I have enjoyed success with people who are just beginning to play, <br>
and have also helped professional bassists fine tune their skills. <br>
Every student is different and I personalize each lesson <br>
to fit the interests and goals of each individual student. <br>
<br>
I've been teaching bass lessons for 22 years.<br>
I teach on Tues, Wed, and Thurs from 4-10pm. <br>
I charge $50 for an hour lesson. <br>
Ask about discounts for prepaid lessons.<br>
<br>
I have professional experience playing a wide variety of musical styles, <br>
including jazz, blues, classic rock, indie rock, and soul music. <br>
<br>
I am located in San Francisco's Richmond District <br>
with easy access by auto or public transportation.<br>

</center></big>
<br>
I am a friendly, talented guitar teacher who has been playing for over 18 years. My teaching style focuses on guitar basics such as chords, strumming patterns, and common song structures so that you can start playing your favorite songs ASAP. This will keep you motivated to stick with it! 
<br>
<br><b>Beginning</b> students progress rapidly from knowing little or nothing about guitar to being able to play literally thousands of songs through chord recognition. <b>Intermediate and advanced</b> students focus on techniques such as advanced strumming patterns, music reading, basic theory, improvisational solo, and sweep/alternate picking.
<br>
<p>I've been in several bands and can help you learn to write songs, pick up popular songs by ear, and perform.

English & ESL Tutor...CHEAP!...Free Consultation!<br>
<br>
Are you  STRUGGLING to learn English?  Are you an ESL student? Are you trying to prepare for a job or career that requires strong English skills? Well, I have lots of experience helping students learn English.  I am a native speaker of English, I am a graduate of the University of California, and I have 25 years experience as an engineer and as a tutor. I also speak fluent Spanish (hablo espanol) and French -- so I know how hard it is to learn a new language! I can help you with your English reading, writing, speaking  and understanding.  I make it simple for you.  I can help you with your grammar, vocabulary, writing, reading, speaking or comprehension -- whatever you need. I can help you; <br>
<br>
Get much higher grades in your ESL classes<br>
<br>
Get rid of your accent -- speak with confidence <br>
<br>
Get that great $$$ job that you really want!! <br>
<br>
I would like to meet you first to present to you, FREE of charge, a detailed plan to develop and improve your English. If you are not satisfied, you don't pay me anything. If you are satisfied, you still get that consultation free, and then we can begin to schedule  tutoring sessions at your convenience -- and I charge only $35 per hour for one-on-one tutoring (slightly higher for groups). I live in Redwood City, but we can meet at any central or convenient location.<br>

Tutor For Writing, Reading, Spanish, French, Math, Sciences. . .CHEAP!!...Free Detailed Consultation!<br>
<br>
<br>
I am an experienced tutor with a very successful, interactive style that allows the student to learn more quickly and comprehend better and retain more. I can tutor any of the following subjects, from elementary through high school level: Writing, Reading, Spanish, French, Math and Sciences. <br>
<br>
I am a graduate of the University of California with a degree in physics and I have been an engineer for the past 25 years. I have also completed 2 years of graduate courses in electrical engineering at Boston Unversity, and a pre-medical program at the University of Hartford. In addition I speak fluent Spanish and French.<br>
<br>
(Ademas, yo hablo espanol y por eso soy capaz de ayudarles a los estudiantes que todavia tienen dificultades para entender o expresarse en ingles.)<br>
<br>
I can help your student:<br>
<br>
	Get much better grades<br>
<br>
	Meet and exceed grade-level performance<br>
<br>
	Get much higher standardized test scores<br>
<br>
	Increase his/her classroom participation<br>
<br>
	Increase his/her motivation and interest in the subject<br>
<br>
	Get on track for college acceptance and academic preparation<br>
<br>
Most importantly, I am committed to the success of your student.<br>
<br>
I offer a FREE, in-detail consultation during which I present to you a program ideally suited to the needs of your student. You can then decide whether or not you like my style. If you don't like it or if you aren't satisfied, then you don't lose anything. But if you are satisfied, then we can schedule future tutoring sessions, according to whatever schedule is convenient for you. My rates are cheap -- I only charge $35 per hour for one-on-one tutoring (slightly higher for groups). I live in Redwood City, but we can meet at any central or convenient location.<br>

Spanish Pronto!! / French Fast!!..Learn Spanish or French Now!..Cheap !!! -- All Levels<br>
<br>
<br>
Nearly half of California residents are native speakers of Spanish. <br>
<br>
Are you a working professional who needs to learn Spanish to communicate well with clients?<br>
<br>
Are you a student who wants to get A's in Spanish classes?<br>
<br>
Are you planning to travel to a Spanish-speaking country soon, for work or pleasure?<br>
<br>
Or do you just want to expand your cultural horizon so that you can communicate fluently with California's largest immigrant community?<br>
<br>
<br>
Begin conversing in Spanish in just 2 weeks!!....Work hard and become fluent in Spanish much much faster than you ever thought possible.<br>
<br>
I have been speaking Spanish for 15 years and have successfully tutored students at all levels over the past 10 years. I am an engineer by profession (1980 UC Santa Cruz graduate) and have studied and taught several languages--so I know by experience which methods are best for learning a foreign language. I take great pride in knowing that I can go anywhere in Latin America and communicate perfectly with the more than 400 million native speakers. I can help you do the same. I can help you get to any level you want--beginning, intermediate, advanced, or beyond.<br>
<br>
I have been speaking French since the 1970's and I can help you master the subtleties and difficulties of this beautiful, internationally spoken language. I studied French intensively in high school and at the University of California, have spent time in France and Switzerland and I have even continued to refine my French-speaking and grammatical skills ever since. It has been challenging and rewarding and I can share the same experience with you. <br>
<br>
Let's meet for a free consultation and I can present to you a program tailored specifically to your level and goals. If you decide you like it, we can schedule lessons according to your convenience. No contracts, no strings attached. You have nothing to lose. I live in Redwood City, but we can meet at any central or convenient location.  And I only charge $35 per hour for one-on-one tutoring (slightly higher for groups). <br>

Or do you just want to expand your cultural horizon so that you can communicate fluently with California's largest immigrant community?<br>
<br>
<br>
Begin conversing in Spanish in just 2 weeks!!....Work hard and become fluent in Spanish much much faster than you ever thought possible.<br>
<br>
I have been speaking Spanish for 15 years and have successfully tutored students at all levels over the past 10 years. I am an engineer by profession (1980 UC Santa Cruz graduate) and have studied and taught several languages--so I know by experience which methods are best for learning a foreign language. I take great pride in knowing that I can go anywhere in Latin America and communicate perfectly with the more than 400 million native speakers. I can help you do the same. I can help you get to any level you want--beginning, intermediate, advanced, or beyond.<br>
<br>
I have been speaking French since the 1970's and I can help you master the subtleties and difficulties of this beautiful, internationally spoken language. I studied French intensively in high school and at the University of California, have spent time in France and Switzerland and I have even continued to refine my French-speaking and grammatical skills ever since. It has been challenging and rewarding and I can share the same experience with you. <br>
<br>
Let's meet for a free consultation and I can present to you a program tailored specifically to your level and goals. If you decide you like it, we can schedule lessons according to your convenience. No contracts, no strings attached. You have nothing to lose. I live in Redwood City, but we can meet at any central or convenient location.  And I only charge $35 per hour for one-on-one tutoring (slightly higher for groups). <br>

I am a credentialed mathematics tutor getting wonderful results with my students. My name is Bob and I have a passion for teaching and have been very successful at imparting mathematics principles to both children and adults.<br>
<br>
I have a Teaching Credential in California, and a local Business License. I am an approved vendor for the Ocean Grove Charter School.<br>
<br>
I am experienced working with students with learning disabilities.<br>
<br>
I work with Elementary, Junior High, and High School level mathematics up through pre-calculus, and also can help students prepare for the SAT, CHSPE, CAHSEE, and college entrance exams. I am available to teach in student's homes in the East Bay area.<br>
<br>
My communication skills are excellent. I am professional, enthusiastic, sensitive to each individual child's needs, and seek to establish trust and communication with my students which facilitate and enhance the learning process.  <br>

Comments from happy families:<br>
<br>
'This is a great tutor!<br>
Last fall we were despairing over our math-challenged son ever getting a good enough grade in Algebra II to take the statistics class he needs (a requirement at West Valley College). He had attempted and not completed several Algebra II classes at this point. We contacted Bob who met with our son weekly for most of the semester. Bob helped raise our son's math scores by a full 1 1/2 grades. Although a grade of "C" doesn't seem like much, it is finally a score he can move on with. We are thrilled and attribute the much better grade to Bob's diligent, quiet and unending explanations and helping to navigate the math maze to our son. We highly recommend Bob to anyone needing a math tutor.'<br>
Eileen S. San Jose<br>
<br>
'I think my daughter will compare all of her future math instructors to Bob and I fear that she will be disappointed. Superior math instructors are very difficult to find; my daughter and I are happy to sing Bob's praises. Bob worked with my daughter for about 1 ½ years to prepare for the CHSPE exam and I have seen a marked improvement in her math skills. He can explain concepts to her in a way she understands which is extremely important to her forward momentum in mathematics. And more importantly, he is extremely patient and kind. Any student in need of mathematics tutoring would be extremely fortunate to have Bob as his/her instructor.'<br>
Homeschooling mom: Brenda F.  San Jose<br>
<br>
'My son would become argumentative at my attempts to work with him with math. When Bob started working with him, he soon won my son over with a quiet charm. Before I knew it, they were zooming through material that we had struggled to get through. Bob was not only effective at teaching my son who was resistant to math, but he also was effective in showing my son what capabilities and skills he had. I am fortunate my son had the opportunity to work with Bob!'<br>

<h2>MUSIC AND BRAINPOWER: Why we proudly offer In-home Piano/Guitar Lessons for Children and Adults</h2><br>
The pace of scientific research into music making has never been greater. New data about music's relationship to brainpower, wellness and other phenomena is changing the way we perceive mankind's oldest art form, and it's having a real-world effect on decisions about educational priorities.<br>
 <br>
For instance, according to the University of Sarasota, and the East Texas State University, middle school and high school students who participated in instrumental music scored significantly higher than their non-band peers in standardized tests. University studies conducted in Georgia and Texas found significant correlations between the number of years of instrumental music instruction and academic achievement in math, science and language arts.<br>
<br>
Also, neurological researches show that the students who were exposed to the music-based lessons scored a full 100 percent higher on fractions tests than those who learned in the conventional manner. Second-grade and third-grade students were taught fractions in an nontraditional manner by teaching them basic music rhythm notation. The group was taught about the relationships between eighth, quarter, half and whole notes. Their peers received traditional fraction instruction.<br>

I've been playing guitar since I was 12 and now I am 34. I started with chords on classical guitar (nylon strings), I took piano lessons for 4 years, then moved to acoustic guitar (metal strings) and learned to play electric guitar, including power chords and solos. I eventually picked up the harmonica.<br>
<br>
If you want to learn to play guitar, whether it's regular chords or power chords, acoustic or electric, or if you want to learn to play your favorite songs, you should contact me. I have learned solfeggio, harmonization and singing. I also recorded music. I have an extensive database of songs that I myself either corrected, arranged or transcribed directly. I can teach you how to play the songs you want to learn, including how to read tablatures.<br>
<br>
My database includes ...<br>
<br>
The Beatles ...<br>

I've been playing guitar since I was 12 and now I am 34. I started with chords on classical guitar (nylon strings), I took piano lessons for 4 years, then moved to acoustic guitar (metal strings) and learned to play electric guitar, including power chords and solos. I eventually picked up the harmonica.<br>
<br>
If you want to learn to play guitar, whether it's regular chords or power chords, acoustic or electric, or if you want to learn to play your favorite songs, you should contact me. I have learned solfeggio, harmonization and singing. I also recorded music. I have an extensive database of songs that I myself either corrected, arranged or transcribed directly. I can teach you how to play the songs you want to learn, including how to read tablatures.<br>
<br>
My database includes ...<br>
<br>
The Beatles ...<br>

Accent Reduction for non-native English speakers is the fastest growing sector of the education industry in the U.S. The global influx of professionals, technicians and workers into the American workforce has created a new dynamic: The American economy, along with the industrial, commercial and academic sectors benefit greatly from this influx of talent. This article illustrates the benefits of the program: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.laprogressive.com/2009/08/06/louis-armstrong-walked-on-the-moon-or-was-he-that-biker-guy/#more-14805">http://www.laprogressive.com/2009/08/06/louis-armstrong-walked-on-the-moon-or-was-he-that-biker-guy/#more-14805</a> <br>
<br>
The downside is that many new workers and leaders have communication and speech difficulties, creating frustrations for co-workers, colleagues, supervisors and clients. Regrettably, many good professionals have lost their jobs because of their communication problems. Others have been reassigned to less important positions, to relieve them of the pressure that comes with working in a language that is not their own. <br>
<br>
This program includes tutoring in civics, and cultural enrichment for people who are new to America, or preparing for the citizenship test. Here is an article I recently published about a recent naturalization ceremony in SF: <br>

Ax Redux © is a new service, designed for professionals and students who are ready to take this initiative. This program picks up where ESL leaves off. Ax Redux(c)is based in the Bay Area, and was recently reviewed in The Contra Costa Times: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/15748756.htm">http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/15748756.htm</a> <br>
<br>
We offer classes in corporate settings for groups of up to four. <br>
<br>
Ax Redux © helps students with the full spectrum of accent reduction issues, including vocabulary and phrases particular to the employee's job or trade. <br>
<br>
Our goal is not accent ELIMINATION, but accent REDUCTION" we recognize the value of people retaining some elements of their native language, as long as they are effective speakers. An accent, as an element of presentation can be charming too much can be distracting or frustrating for the listener or audience. <br>
<br>
Ax Redux (c) is based on a system of phonetics for breaking down pronunciation, and helps students with the full spectrum of accent reduction issues including: <br>
1.) Proper consonant sound, with regard to hard, soft or irregular. <br>
2.) Proper vowel sound with regard to long or short. <br>
3.) Placing the accent on the proper syllable. <br>
4.) Developing awareness about how sounds and values of letters change with regard to their initial, medial or final placement in a word. <br>
5.) Proper placement of tongue, lips, teeth and other physical components. <br>
<br>
Though my foreign language studies were limited to Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish and German, this system is easily applied to any language of the student's origin. Regardless of the student's native linguistic tradition, the physical corrections are the same, with regard to the physical therapy involved in making corrections. <br>
<br>
English is my best language. We also give healthy doses of cultural enrichment and Americana, as the lessons lend themselves to it. All students have expressed gratitude for these value-added elements. Visit our website at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.accentredux.com/">http://www.accentredux.com/</a><br>
