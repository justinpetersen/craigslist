Hey,<br>
I am looking for someone who lives in Fremont.<br>
There is actually no job to do, I am working an advertisement firm and they want to advertise in Fremont.<br>
This requires me to send a letter from Google there that requires a mailing address to get the verification code.<br>
So I need to send 4 letters and you get 20$ for each letter.<br>
All you need to do is give me the verification code found in the letter and I will pay you 20$ for each one.<br>
<br>
This is 100% legit and once I get the letters I will remove your address and it won't be shown anywhere or noted anywhere.<br>
<br>
I can do this with PO Boxes, its just more time consuming and costs a little more, so I thought it would be nice to give someone the money who really needs it.<br>
<br>
Email me if you are intersted, only need one person.

My fiance and I are seeking a non denominational officiant for our February 19th wedding. We are a fun loving happy couple that are having a DIYwedding and we are on a very tight budget. We are looking to hire an officiant for the event for approximately 100-150. We wont need a rehearsal and we're not really going to say our own vows. We just need someone to help us out. Food will be provided =) Please email me if you think you can or know of someone who can help us out. Thanks so much

Looking for a DJ on New Years Eve from 10 PM - 2 AM.  Would need to provide all the equipment.  Expecting about 100-120 people to be there.  Really have no idea what a DJ runs (particularly on NYE), so email if interested and let me know what your services would cost.  Thanks.

Looking for a DJ on New Years Eve from 10 PM - 2 AM.  Would need to provide all the equipment.  Expecting about 100-120 people to be there.  Really have no idea what a DJ runs (particularly on NYE), so email if interested and let me know what your services would cost.  Thanks.

Hey there!<br>
<br>
We are loooking for a couple of friendly and and able bodies to work our holiday christmas party December 10th!<br>
<br>
1) We need a santa model: All we need you to do is sit there and lean against the backdrop and take pictures with party guests. While we cannot pay you, you will be working for tips. Dance a little, pose a little, and help yourself to food, drink, and live music. <br>
<br>
2) work the door: this is an ugly sweater, no pants party. We only ask that you make sure guests do not enter the building unless they are wearing an incredibly ugly sweater and have taken their pants off. You will be responsible for this as well as a "pants check" Again, we cannot pay you but you will be working for tips<br>
<br>
Our invite list is up to 200+ people, but admittedly we only expect half or less...Either way you stand to have a great time and make a little cash!<br>
<br>
<br>
send us a response with a little note about yourself, a photo, and your phone number! thanks! <br>

Hi,<br>
I am a pharmaceutical sales representative with a monthly expense account to spend on doctor's offices for breakfasts and lunches. I need a caterer who can travel as far north as Ukiah and as far South as Sausalito.  I would like to be able to tell the caterer when and where the meeting is, how many people, what genre of food the office would like and then not worry about anything else.  Must take American Express and be able to make my money go far.  Please email me if you can help.<br>

Hi, we are a community of startup founders, having a pitch event tomorrow evening in SOMA. We are looking for a videographer who could tape our 1.5 hours of panel and presentations with angel investors. <br>
What you get in return:<br>
1. Connections to founders and investors -- we are always hiring<br>
2. Free participation in the wine reception<br>
3. Future work -- we are a young group, but we are growing fast, so we will be able to pay in the future.<br>
<br>
If you would like to volunteer, email us today, we'll get right back to you.<br>
Thanks!

Hello all clowns / entertainers!<br>
<br>
I'm working on an experimental short film, & would like to capture some footages of the different aspects of a clown's job, kind of  a 'day in the life of...' concept.<br>
<br>
I am looking for any type of clown or entertainer where you dress up and have to perform at parties / festivals etc. And I would like to just follow you for a day when you happen to have a gig or a job.<br>
<br>
I will not be in your way, and you will get a video of my edited work. A token compensation for your time can also be discussed. :)<br>
<br>
Please email me if you think this sounds like fun and we can talk more!

We are seeking several sushi chefs for a catering event on Friday December 2nd.  The time is from 5PM to Midnight.  Both nigiri and rolls will need to be made, so chefs with more experience and who are speedier will be paid more.  This gig is on-site.  Please respond immediately with your name, phone number, and a little bit about your background and we will call you today (Tuesday).

We are seeking several sushi chefs for a catering event on Friday December 2nd.  The time is from 5PM to Midnight.  Both nigiri and rolls will need to be made, so chefs with more experience and who are speedier will be paid more.  This gig is on-site.  Please respond immediately with your name, phone number, and a little bit about your background and we will call you today (Tuesday).
