<br>
are you a color film photographer?<br>
<br>
do you wish you had the time, money and resources to make beautiful C-41 prints <br>
<br>
on Fuji Crystal Archival Paper?<br>
<br>
are you a fine artist looking to create Chromogenic prints for your portfolio or upcoming show?<br>
<br>
perhaps you're an amateur photographer who has lots of cherished memories captured on color negative film<br>
<br>
and you're tired of crappy digital prints from walgreens or expensive scans + prints from small print shops here in SF?<br>
<br>
<br>
this is my answer and solution:<br>
<br>
my name is mikey baratta and i am a fine arts photographer, a BFA Photography major from SFAI.<br>
<br>
my specialty is color, c-41 printing, a dying and lost photographic art.<br>
<br>
i have been an intern and darkroom technician at RAYKO PHOTO CENTER <br>
<br>
(located near the freeway underpass on Harrison near 3rd street in SOMA, website here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://raykophoto.com/">http://raykophoto.com/</a> )<br>
<br>
for the past three years now.<br>
<br>
<br>
for this holiday season, if you want to give your friends and family a truly unique gift <br>
<br>
of a family photograph printed in a color dark room please contact me to make your <br>
<br>
dream come true.<br>
<br>
<br>
currently i have 8x10 fuji matt paper but can print larger sizes upon request.<br>
<br>
i have an hourly rate of $15 an hour (takes about 1.5-2 hours to create a print)<br>
<br>
and can provide hand color retouching for an extra $25 fee <br>
<br>
(prices are based upon a single 8x10 print; for more than one print per order or for special orders price will be negotiated).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
let me stress this; i DO NOT work for RAYKO PHOTO CENTER. i am an intern and this is a project i am starting on the side to make<br>
<br>
more money through this holiday season. proceeds will not go to RAYKO. i am simply a photographer who can lend a hand with his<br>
<br>
craft.<br>
<br>
<br>
please look at my website listed below.<br>
<br>
if interested in seeing my actual c-41 prints we can arrange a meeting in-person<br>
<br>
at RAYKO PHOTO CENTER.<br>
<br>
<br>
thank you for your time and consideration,<br>

Are you looking for creative wedding photography that really captures the special nature of your unique ceremony? Then check us out. We are a husband-and-wife team that has been working together for over 10 years. Our background in photojournalism and visual art allows us to craft images that capture the emotions and stories of your wedding. We work with you to make sure we understand exactly what you are looking for from your photography, and we tailor each shoot to the personality of the individual couple.<br>
<br>
Our packages start at 4 hours for $1000.00 and 6 hours for $1500.00. This includes two photographers, a private website, a disc of the images (high-res and low-res files) and basic post-production. For packages that include 6 hours and up, a free engagement portrait is included. Albums and print packages are also available. We have recently been awarded the Bride's choice award on Wedding Wire and our work has been published in several local and national magazines, including Town & Country Weddings. References available upon request.<br>

Our packages start at 4 hours for $1000.00 and 6 hours for $1500.00. This includes two photographers, a private website, a disc of the images (high-res and low-res files) and basic post-production. For packages that include 6 hours and up, a free engagement portrait is included. Albums and print packages are also available. We have recently been awarded the Bride's choice award on Wedding Wire and our work has been published in several local and national magazines, including Town & Country Weddings. References available upon request.<br>

We would love to hear from you, so check out our site and let us know if you like what you see.<br>

<center>At YStudio, we are happy to welcome aboard our NEW "Bebe" Collection! If you are wondering what this is, ooh baby baby have we got stuff to show YOU!<br>
<img src="http://ystudiophotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MG_3288.jpg" width="940" height="705" alt="undefined"><br>
Being primarily Wedding Photographers, we have had the pleasure of meeting all types of people!  We meet bridesmaids who are engaged, getting married, or people having bebe's!  Our brides themselves often send us a card announcing they are having babies, and here we go again!  We just love what we do, we become part of the family per se, and we are honored to be capturing the memories of the new families to come!  <br>
<br>
Meet Jason Ryan, he is a lovely little boy who was born on March 21, 2011!  I met his wonderful mommy Heather in 2009, she was the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/bridal-party/articles/maid-of-honor-duties-in-detail.aspx">MOH</a> for a fabulous bride whose wedding I photographed.  I have kept in touch with Natalie as I do all of my clients, and when Heather contacted me to photograph her newborn bundle of joy, I was ecstatic!  To have someone love your work, honor it's worth, entrust and then contact you to capture their first born, you know you are doing a lot of things right!  We work hard to share photo campaigns and stories of our progress on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/ystudiophotography">Facebook</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ystudiofoto">Twitter</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ystudiophotography.com">blogs</a>, and if there is anything I can say about Social Media...it's WOW!  It's a great way to let everyone know about us, what we love to do and to share with the world some beautiful moments and imagery.<br>
<br>
If you would like to inquire about how we can capture your cherished memories, please contact us, and mention Craigslist for a FREE bonus gift once you book!<br>

My name is Christoph and I am a videographer with a huge archive of personal videos on youtube at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/realize2actualize">http://www.youtube.com/realize2actualize</a><br>
<br>
I would like to offer my services to video record your next big event, party, meeting, lecture, performance, or even create a promotional video for you. <br>
<br>
In addition to me video recording on my small but powerful Canon HD video camera with a small external microphone to pick up the sound even from a distance, I am able to edit the recorded material, either on my own, or we can work together on the editing part so you can show me exactly what you would like. I am also able to enhance the video with animations, different filters, effects, pictures and music. After all of this is done I can either upload the final project online so you can download it from there, or for a little extra charge I can provide you with the video on SD, flashcard or DVD.<br>
<br>
I am very good at interviewing people with a sense of humor, asking pertinent questions, engaging others in a fun and relaxed way as to communicate on a deep and meaningful level.<br>
<br>
Instead of charging a fixed hourly rate I work on a very flexible sliding scale depending on what you can afford and what this is worth to you, usually between $25-$40 per hour.<br>
<br>
<br>
For more information please contact me for a free evaluation.<br>

***'Tis the season! Book your session before January 1st, and Katie Takes Pictures will donate 20% of the price of your order to the charity of your choosing! Isn't giving grand?<br>
<br>
I believe in using warm, natural light for my photographs -- the organic way -- in a location that suits you best. I will travel to your home or favorite outdoor spot to capture you in your best light. You will be photographed naturally, enjoying the beauty around you and with minimal posing involved. I use flash only when absolutely necessary. My portrait sessions are very laid back and no stress. I do my best to be a fly on the wall, to capture the purest of moments. However I'd be happy to make suggestions if that is something you'd like. I primarily photograph portraits -- weddings, engagement announcements, surprise engagements, maternity stages, babies and children, families, and personal portraits. But I also love to photograph parties and pets. Photographing people is what I do and what I love. I'd love to take your portrait! <br>
<br>
*Check out www.katietakespictures.com for further details and to reserve your session. Talk to you soon!<br>

***'Tis the season! Book your session before January 1st, and Katie Takes Pictures will donate 20% of the price of your order to the charity of your choosing! Isn't giving grand?<br>
<br>
I believe in using warm, natural light for my photographs -- the organic way -- in a location that suits you best. I will travel to your home or favorite outdoor spot to capture you in your best light. You will be photographed naturally, enjoying the beauty around you and with minimal posing involved. I use flash only when absolutely necessary. My portrait sessions are very laid back and no stress. I do my best to be a fly on the wall, to capture the purest of moments. However I'd be happy to make suggestions if that is something you'd like. I primarily photograph portraits -- weddings, engagement announcements, surprise engagements, maternity stages, babies and children, families, and personal portraits. But I also love to photograph parties and pets. Photographing people is what I do and what I love. I'd love to take your portrait! <br>
<br>
*Check out www.katietakespictures.com for further details and to reserve your session. Talk to you soon!<br>

My name is Araya Diaz and I'm an experienced Bay Area photographer. I love photographing children and babies and mama belly's of all sizes.<br>
<br>
I invite you to look at some of my work - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://araya.smugmug.com/gallery/8826452_ExqkN#584735612_PrJTw">http://araya.smugmug.com/gallery/8826452_ExqkN#584735612_PrJTw</a><br>
<br>
My rates are very reasonable and I have years of experience. Only $200 for a two hour session, a cd with full rez images, 5 Photoshopped (i.e. black & white) images and a gallery to order prints from and share with friends and family.<br>
<br>
Travel fees may apply if you live more than 15 miles from S. Berkeley.<br>
<br>
I look forward to working with you.

My name is Araya Diaz and I'm an experienced Bay Area photographer. I love photographing children and babies and mama belly's of all sizes.<br>
<br>
I invite you to look at some of my work - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://araya.smugmug.com/gallery/8826452_ExqkN#584735612_PrJTw">http://araya.smugmug.com/gallery/8826452_ExqkN#584735612_PrJTw</a><br>
<br>
My rates are very reasonable and I have years of experience. Only $200 for a two hour session, a cd with full rez images, 5 Photoshopped (i.e. black & white) images and a gallery to order prints from and share with friends and family.<br>
<br>
Travel fees may apply if you live more than 15 miles from S. Berkeley.<br>
<br>
I look forward to working with you.

Need to sell that property?<br>
<br>
My inks sell properties, and so does my color work (marker, watercolor, guoache, etc.).<br>
<br>
I do very nice inks (small to large)  for small prices for those ads in Real Estate Times and the Newspaper and your flyers - something nice enough to sell the property and to give to the buyer as a bonus to use in their announcements to friends and family about their new home!<br>
<br>
Also, I do very nice color work, in many media, for residential and commercial.  Some of my work has been in books for almost 20 years (John Wiley Press, Marker Magic) and a watercolor of Fallingwater that was sold for a while in poster form at the gift shop at Fallingwater.<br>
<br>
I do all kinds of styles, so drawing them for your illustrations is not a problem!<br>

I'm a part-time photographer available for and interested in shooting weddings, parties, and other social and business events. I take the digital photos, burn them to a DVD, and they're yours. That's it; no prints, albums, or expensive packages; just nice pictures for a fair price. It's an ideal choice for smaller or limited-budget celebrations, and informal occasions and gatherings.<br>
<br>
I make no pretenses; I'm not the best, nor the cheapest. However, if you want good photography at an affordable cost, I fit the bill.<br>

Its your lucky day.!  If you'r looking for great tattoo work at a discounted rate  I'm your man. I have been tattooing for a little over a year and am looking to expand my portfolio.<br>
<br>
I can tattoo a design you have or design something for you. I have new needles for every client and all my work is 100% sterile.<br>
<br>
Check out some of my work on mysapce at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/2feathersTattoo/273233312694141?sk=photos">http://www.facebook.com/pages/2feathersTattoo/273233312694141?sk=photos</a><br>
<br>
If you are looking for sterile equipment and clean work, give us a call to discuss your  tattoo ideas.<br>
<br>
 I'm at least half if not 3/4 cheaper than a shop.<br>

I am highly experienced and very proficient in both applications. I have been using Photoshop since version 4.0 was released in 1996 , and I have used InDesign since version 1.0 was released in 1999. While I don't know everything there is to know about these two apps, I do know a lot, and I am a competent producer in either app. If you offer me a project that is beyond my capabilities, I will say so up front as I don't wish to waste any time, either yours or mine. My current application level for these apps is CS4. I am competent within Acrobat Pro and Illustrator too, and I am experienced at integrating all 4 apps. In addition to my design experience, I have been involved in the SF Bay Area printing industry for over 20 years, and as a result I have an in depth understanding of print production issues. I have reasonable rates and can provide references upon request.</blockquote></small></p>

If you're struggling with a writing project (or job/career), it may be because you are not in alignment with your highest truth, your life purpose and, therefore, have trouble moving forward.

In a psychic reading I discover what the struggle is about; I uncover your life purpose, and from there it becomes pretty easy to see what needs to be done to move forward successfully.

<br><strong>This is a better deal than Groupon</strong>--because my Dating Profile Portrait Photography Packages are tailored just for you and your dating profile. <br>

<br>My name is David Lessin and I am a top-rated professional portrait photographer. In the spirit of Groupon, I am offering you incredible portrait photography packages specifically created to boost the responses to your online dating profile.<br>

<br>I am the original natural light, lifestyle, photojournalist, portrait photographer and I love collaborating with people who do not enjoy having their picture taken. You get a creative, seasoned, accomplished professional photographer and you save 50% or more on my services.  <br>

<br>I come to your location--to your home, your office, your favorite park or beach--whatever location speaks to you. Once there, we will capture the authentic you--warm, relaxed and basking in natural light. I can also suggest some incredible natural and urban locations that we can utilize for your portraits. <br>

<br>But hurry and book now. This special pricing won't last long. This is a limited time offer and I have limited availability. <br>

<br><strong>Your Complete Satisfaction is 100% Guaranteed:<br>
If for any reason you do not absolutely love the images that we capture from your portrait session, I will gladly give you a full refund or I will re-shoot your entire portrait session at no extra charge--for free!<br></strong> 

<br>You have nothing to lose! Just give me a call at 415-299-1327 or email me using the Craigslist email system and let me know exactly what you are looking for and we will work together to come up with a package that fits your needs and your budget!<br>

I know the Bay Area very well having lived here most of my life. I have driven for five different taxi companies in the last 30 years in the Bay Area and owned a cab company on Hawaii.<br>
<br>
I'm based in Mill Valley but will drive anywhere.<br>
<br>
Your vehicle or mine (2001 Nissan Sentra GXE 4 door sedan with low mileage).<br>

Related personal errands and services included. I have quite a bit of experience with senior caregiving.<br>
<br>
I have a clean DMV record (except for a seat belt ticket).<br>
<br>
I charge $20/hr within Marin. $20 minimum.<br>
<br>
Flat rates way below taxi rates for out of town service.<br>

"I can't say enough good things about Stephen. He is kind, reliable, punctual, trustworthy, will go out of his way to help you, positive energy & a skilled driver. I have a spine problem and I can't sit, so I have to lie down while he drives me. He has been driving me for 2 years. I have never heard a squeal of brakes, or experienced any sudden driving movements in 2 years. I can't recommend him enough, he has great character, there have never been any problems. I have also used him to do errands for me which has been very helpful. <br>

<br>
 "I was referred to Stephen when I found it difficult to drive for several months as a result of back problems. Though elderly I was still attending the office in San Francisco at that time for a couple of days a week for short days (and I still am). Stephen has picked me up punctually from Corte Madera and dropped me off in the Financial Center - outside of the heavy commute hours - and the reverse in the late afternoon. He has made it very comfortable for me and tended to my getting in and out of the car with great patience. I have complete confidence in his driving.<br>

Does your website need improvement? Is the text persuasive? Does it help to sell your business?<br>
<br>
Your website is a powerful marketing tool. To achieve its purpose, the writing needs to be compelling. Stylish design and pretty pictures are not enough. It needs to hold the reader's interest through the written words. It needs to get the information out there as efficiently as possible. Don't risk losing prospective clients. Have it written or edited by a professional.<br>
<br>
Contact me. Whatever your business is I offer creative ideas, excellent writing, and I charge competitive rates.<br>

<br><br>Hello,
<br>
<br>
I'm Jeannie Zukav of Tarot Readings by Jeannie.  It is been my honor to do Intuitive Tarot Readings in the Bay Area since 1989.  I specialize in life path and relationship Readings.  Intuitive Tarot Readings help to keep relationships strong and honest by increasing awareness and understanding around each person's  needs and the needs of the relationship.
<br>
<br>
I've put together some information about my work to help answer questions you may have.
<br>
<br>
<b>About Your Intuitive Reading with Jeannie:</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>What can I expect during a Reading with You?</b>
<br>
<br>
As an Intuitive, I will convey what is happening in your life right now and how it is influencing you.  If we use cards, you will have the benefit of a deeply symbolic representation of your present situation too.  We will work together, bringing out your best qualities, to make sure you are creating the life your heart dreams of.  For Relationship Readings I will throw down 3 rows of cards, one row for each person and a third row for the relationship.
<br>
<br>
<b>Where are you located and how much time should I schedule for my Reading?</b>
<br>
<br>
I'm located in San Francisco's sunny Mission-Dolores district, near Dolores Park.  A Couple's Reading takes about 2 hours, Individual Readings usually run about 1 hour.  Keeping in mind that each situation is unique, you may wish to schedule more, or less time.  When we speak before your appointment, we can determine how much time you may need.
<br>
<br>
<b>What do I do to prepare for my Intuitive Reading?</b>
<br>
<br>
Nothing really.  Just be you.  If you like, you can bring a recorder to record your session.  Sometimes, things I say make more sense later.  Or you can bring something to take notes with.
<br>
<br>
<b>How much does it cost?</b> 
<br>
<br>
Please contact me for rates as they vary depending on the service (personal, event, class).  Personal Readings are about the cost of any counseling session.    
<br>
<br>
<b>How do I schedule an appointment with You?</b>
<br>
<br>
The best way to schedule an appointment for your Reading is to phone me at 415/267-3970 and leave a message. I will be happy to contact you as soon as I'm able.  You will receive a call back within 24 hours.
<br>
<br>


I'll look forward to Reading for You!
<br><br>
Jeannie Zukav

Wouldn't it be nice to have an Assistant/Designated Driver for any occasion? No matter what you're doing, or where you're going, I'll do the driving while you either relax or party or kick back and handle your business. I am able to assist on tasks also, if you deem fit. I mean like helping organize stuff, running errands, make phone calls or help collect bills/debts.  I have many references and am a responsible, honest person with a good work ethic.  Try it once, check it out, if I'm not worth it,  don't pay me. Please be reasonable.  Thank you.<br>

Wouldn't it be nice to have an Assistant/Designated Driver for any occasion? No matter what you're doing, or where you're going, I'll do the driving while you either relax or party or kick back and handle your business. I am able to assist on tasks also, if you deem fit. I mean like helping organize stuff, running errands, make phone calls or help collect bills/debts.  I have many references and am a responsible, honest person with a good work ethic.  Try it once, check it out, if I'm not worth it,  don't pay me. Please be reasonable.  Thank you.<br>

<br>
-- Is your life in a slump and you don't know why or what to do about it?<br>
-- Are you unhappy in a job or a career and don't know what to do next?<br>
-- Do you feel at the end of a relationship emotionally, and don't know why or what to do about it?<br>
-- Do you feel that your life is over, but you're still here and wonder why?<br>
<br>
If you're going through any of these experiences, what can illuminate the problem, bring clarity, reveal new directions, and get you moving is a psychic reading.<br>
<br>
A psychic reading is helpful where other modalities are limiting. It offers a perspective for all levels of reality: spiritual, emotional, mental and physical. Only in seeing all of you do parts make sense. And only in knowing the whole picture do answers appear. Then it becomes easy to move forward. <br>
