Graphic artist needed to help promote community bookstore. Applicant should be well versed in InDesign and Photoshop with some background in creating promotional brochures and signs. Help with our website (dharmapublishingbookstore.com) would be a plus. Work can be done in our Berkeley location or from your home. This work would be project oriented, rather than regular days and hours. While this is a volunteer position, it is an excellent opportunity to work on your portfolio and help support a good cause.<br>
<br>
Dharma Publishing has been publishing Buddhist books and art since the early 1970s, and has recently opened a bookstore in the heart of downtown Berkeley. We are a non-profit organization with all proceeds going towards re-establishing libraries in Tibetan monasteries and nunneries throughout the Himalayan region.<br>
<br>
We have several organizations located in close proximity and all our work is done by volunteers- short-term, long-term, and part-time - looking for personal growth, meaningful work, and a community that shares their goals. We are located one block from BART, the Berkeley Public Library and YMCA, and a few blocks from the U.C. campus.<br>

Volunteer interns wanted for opportunity to learn biotechnology research from senior investigators. Research will involve application of molecular biology techniques to the development of novel protein-based therapeutics. Interns will be expected to commit at least 15 hours/week (during normal business hours: M-F from 10am-5pm) for at least 6 months. Some knowledge of undergraduate level chemistry and biology is desirable. This is a volunteer position, so no compensation is available. The internship is sponsored by a partnership between RSI, a non-profit academic research organization, and PRI, a leader in biotechnology research and development based in the heart of the Silicon Valley in Sunnyvale, CA. Please include a resume with any relevant information.

The Stanford Decision Neuroscience Lab is currently inviting healthy individuals between the ages of 8 and 18 to participate in a study. <hr><img src="http://einstein.stanford.edu/images/logo_stanford-50px.gif"><font color="red"><h1>Decision & Development Study</h1></font><hr><br>
<font color="red"><h3>What is our goal?</h3></font> Shall I do my homework or watch a movie? We make many decisions everyday, weighing short term vs. long-term goals. In the Decision Neuroscience Lab we are studying the development of decision-making, by looking at changes in brain function and structure. Our goal is to better understand the brain processes involved in how we make everyday decisions and how that changes when we get older. <br>
<font color="red"><h3>Who can help us? </h3></font>We are looking for <b>boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 18</b>. Children must be native English speakers and in good health. Children will undergo comprehensive cognitive skills assessment. Following behavioral testing, children may be asked to take part in one MRI session, in which brain anatomy and functional properties will be measured. All testing and scanning will be conducted at Stanford University. <br>
<font color="red"><h3>What will my child gain from participating? </h3></font>Children will experience science in action! They will be compensated for their participation and will receive a  picture of their own brain from the MRI scan. What will parents receive? Parents will receive the results of their children's behavioral assessment and will be briefed about the progress of the study. <font color="green"><b>The current experiment will take about 1 to 2 hours and compensation is $20 per hour</b></font>. <br>
<font color="red"><h3>What is fMRI?</h3></font> Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a non-invasive imaging technique. It does not involve any x-rays. fMRI allows us to determine what areas of the brain are working while a person is reading or thinking. A fMRI scan involves lying on a table, which goes into a large magnet. Children with permanent braces or metal in their body will not be able to participate. <br>

Children will undergo comprehensive cognitive skills assessment. Following behavioral testing, children may be asked to take part in one MRI session, in which brain anatomy and functional properties will be measured. All testing and scanning will be conducted at Stanford University. <br>
<font color="red"><h3>What will my child gain from participating? </h3></font>Children will experience science in action! They will be compensated for their participation and will receive a  picture of their own brain from the MRI scan. What will parents receive? Parents will receive the results of their children's behavioral assessment and will be briefed about the progress of the study. <font color="green"><b>The current experiment will take about 1 to 2 hours and compensation is $20 per hour</b></font>. <br>
<font color="red"><h3>What is fMRI?</h3></font> Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a non-invasive imaging technique. It does not involve any x-rays. fMRI allows us to determine what areas of the brain are working while a person is reading or thinking. A fMRI scan involves lying on a table, which goes into a large magnet. Children with permanent braces or metal in their body will not be able to participate. <br>

What is a Super Volunteer? A Super Volunteer is someone that is extra well organized and has management skills. A volunteer coordinator!
<br>Someone that can manage and coordinate all the terrific volunteers we get to help us. 
<br>Someone that can explain our program to them.
<br>Someone that can coordinate efforts so the right tasks get done. 
<br>Someone that can hold monthly orientations and give tours.
<br>Someone that can help recruit more terrific volunteers. 
<br>
<br>
Could this be you? We know it would be a big commitment but the rewards are great. You'll see lots of smiling children and happy formerly homeless animals.

Cat Town, an Oakland-based cat rescue organization, is looking for people to foster cats coming out of Oakland Animal Services (Oakland's municipal shelter). Some of our cats are really easy going, and just need a safe place while they wait for a permanent home. Others require experienced cat people. In either case, Cat town will provide tons of support and all of the supplies necessary for as long as the cat is in your care.
<br><br>
Cat Town focuses on semi-feral kittens, older cats, and cats who are extremely shy, undersocialized and/or stressed.
<br><br>
If you are interested in learning more about this opportunity, or in supporting Cat Town in other ways, please respond to this posting.

Cat Town is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, formed by long term volunteers from Oakland Animal Services (OAS) and other Bay Area shelters.

I need a 1-time volunteer to drive me from the Oakland Lakeshore area to the Kaiser Richmond hospital for an outpatient procedure and then back to Lakeshore area. They will not let me drive myself or take public transportation. I can schedule the procedure to fit your schedule but it must be during normal business hours. Total time is about 1.5 - 2 hours.

The Tech Museum is no ordinary museum, and our volunteers are not ordinary museum docents. The Tech Museum serves a diverse population, including international visitors, local families, and school groups--we often have over 1000 students visiting the museum for field trips on a given day. Volunteers have the opportunity to staff exhibits and interact with museum visitors. A typical day could include helping guests experience the power of major world earthquakes, leading kids in simple hands-on science projects, or letting visitors feel what maneuvering in space is like in the "Jet Pack" simulation. <br>
<br>
You don't have to be a teacher or an engineer to succeed as a volunteer--we provide hands-on training and mentorship to ensure your success. If you are 18 or older and enjoy working with people, we know you'll enjoy joining our close-knit community of Silicon Valley supporters.<br>
<br>
We are looking for volunteers to come in for regular (weekly or biweekly) shifts, from 8:30am-1pm or 12:30-5pm on Monday through Friday. We also offer evening volunteer opportunities on an occasional basis.  (Our current weekend high school program is full until Summer 2012). <br>
<br>
Benefits of volunteering include: <br>
* Free museum entry and educational IMAX films<br>
* Free downtown parking while you work <br>
* Discount on special traveling exhibits for you and your family <br>
* Discount in the store, cafe, and Hollywood IMAX films <br>
* Ongoing training and support for an exciting and rewarding volunteer experience<br>
<br>
If you are interested in volunteering, please complete an online application, located on our website: www.thetech.org/about/volunteer. If you have questions, please get in touch with us at (408) 795-6205 or volunteer@thetech.org.<br>

This is a wonderful opportunity to volunteer as an advocate and crisis counselor for victims of sexual assault. The work that we engage in is very rewarding, both personally and professionally. It allows for the opportunity to have direct client contact as well as to become a part of a community working to end sexual violence.<br>
<br>
Our volunteers provide support, assistance, and resources to survivors or significant others who call our 24-hour hotline or who are in need of accompaniment to a forensic-medical exam.<br>
<br>
Those interested in becoming a volunteer should e-mail rccvolunteer@ywca-sv.org . You will then receive an application to fill out and return via e-mail or fax. Upon receipt of the application, the volunteer coordinator will schedule an interview with you.<br>
<br>
In order to serve as a certified rape crisis counselor in the state of California you must complete a mandated 40-hour training. Once you have applied to become a volunteer, you will be eligible for our next training which will take place during evenings and weekends beginning in late Feburary!<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please contact Kaitlin Sullivan at 408-295-4011 ext. 229.<br>

<h2>There are 43 boys and 27 girls waiting for a Mentor. . .could one be waiting for you? </h2>
<p> Many kids need someone to spend a consistent amount of time with. Play some video games, go on a hike, explore the city. If you care about your community and want to make it a safe, positive place for all, consider becoming a mentor.</p>

<p> Friends for Youth has been serving at-risk youth residing in San Mateo and Northern Santa Clara counties for over 32 years.  By providing training and on-going support, it is our goal to find people who wish not only to be mentors, but also to be friends to the kids in our program.</p>

<h2>There are 43 boys and 27 girls waiting for a Mentor. . .could one be waiting for you? </h2>
<p> Many kids need someone to spend a consistent amount of time with. Play some video games, go on a hike, explore the city. If you care about your community and want to make it a safe, positive place for all, consider becoming a mentor.</p>

<p> Friends for Youth has been serving at-risk youth residing in San Mateo and Northern Santa Clara counties for over 32 years.  By providing training and on-going support, it is our goal to find people who wish not only to be mentors, but also to be friends to the kids in our program.</p>

Why wait to help change someone's life? You don't need special skills to be a mentor, just the desire to make a difference.<br>

WHY SHOULD I BE A MENTOR???<br>

Testimonial from a current Mentor: <br>
<br>
"Over the year, I've become a pretty integral part of my mentee's young life. We have a schedule where we go laser tagging, play ball, visit a ton of tourist attractions, baseball games, the library, etc. These activities really help to build my mentee's self-esteem and give him the ability to escape his often chaotic environment at home and in his neighborhood. <br>
<br>
The program's been pretty rewarding in my life too, allowing me to reconnect with my inner child and exposing me to neighborhoods and cultures outside of my comfort zone. <br>
I can't recommend the Building Futures program enough. Try it out, you'll be surprised by the impact you can make in someone's life." <br>

A child's third grade reading scores can predict with 70% accuracy the likelihood they will graduate from high school. Early literacy impacts all aspects of a child's life from academic performance across subject areas to self-confidence and enthusiasm for learning. <p>

88% of young people from low-income communities cannot read at grade level. The power of your one-on-one attention and caring can make an incredible difference.<p>

Reading Partners provides an opportunity and a space for volunteers from the community to give a fraction of their time each week to tutor an elementary school student one-on-one in reading using a structured and easy-to-follow curriculum.<p>

With just 1 hour a week, you can make a huge difference in the lives of children who have fallen behind in reading and are at risk of falling further. One-on-one instruction at the student's reading level provides the opportunity for individualized academic attention and a healthy learning relationship with you, the volunteer. Volunteers are, in turn, supported at all times by Reading Partners school site coordinators and staff.<p>

<b>We are recruiting for the 2011 - 2012 school year.</b><p>

Reading Partners has reading centers at elementary schools throughout San Francisco and the Bay Area, including:<br>
John Gill Elementary School (Redwood City)<br>
Hawes Elementary School (Redwood City)<br>
San Mateo Park Elementary School (San Mateo)<br>
Selby Lane School (Atherton)<br>

A child's third grade reading scores can predict with 70% accuracy the likelihood they will graduate from high school. Early literacy impacts all aspects of a child's life from academic performance across subject areas to self-confidence and enthusiasm for learning. <p>

Reading Partners provides an opportunity and a space for volunteers from the community to give a fraction of their time each week to tutor an elementary school student one-on-one in reading using a structured and easy-to-follow curriculum.<p>

With just 1 hour a week, you can make a huge difference in the lives of children who have fallen behind in reading and are at risk of falling further. One-on-one instruction at the student's reading level provides the opportunity for individualized academic attention and a healthy learning relationship with you, the volunteer. Volunteers are, in turn, supported at all times by Reading Partners school site coordinators and staff.<p>

<b>We are recruiting for the 2011 - 2012 school year.</b><p>

Reading Partners has reading centers at elementary schools throughout the East Bay, including:<br>
Longwood Elementary School (Hayward)<br>
Laurel Elementary School (Oakland - Laurel)<br>
Cox/Reach Academies (East Oakland / Iveywood)<br>
Lazear Elementary School (Oakland - West Fruitvale)<br>
Brookfield Elementary School (Oakland South / Airport)<br>
Learning Without Limits (Oakland - Fruitvale / Maxwell Park)<br>
Riverside Elementary School (San Pablo)<br>
Hillside Elementary School (San Leandro)<p> 

Pick any 1-hour time slot that's convenient for you between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Thursday (you are welcome to help more if able). <p>

For more information or to register to volunteer, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://readingpartners.org/volunteer">http://readingpartners.org/volunteer</a>. <p> 

70% of our tutors have little to no education experience. Anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer with us!</p>

Our arts administration interns learn valuable skills through "hands on" experience. They play a pivotal role in and out of the CounterPULSE office, assisting our Managing Director with all aspects of administration, and are a key member of the staff. This position is active and varied. Its duties range from attendance and secretarial tasks at board and staff meetings, to correspondence with donors, to management of databases and demographic surveys, as well as everyday office tasks. The program intern also has the opportunity to accrue skills in curatorial strategies and philosophies, and to gain a fundamental understanding of the general ebb and flow of a non-profit community arts space.<br>
They are also encouraged to initiate independent projects applicable to their interests, and to fully bring their voice and critical thought to the development and identity of CounterPULSE. Candidates should have basic computer knowledge (including MS Word and Excel), excellent phone and people skills, and enthusiasm for working with a diverse public.<br>

Hello everyone in the Santa Cruz/ Monterey County. I am on here attempting to make somewhat of an odd request since I am not affiliated with any non-profit organization, nonetheless; seek to make a difference in the life of others. Let me begin by introducing myself, my name is Blanca and I am a 21 year old student at California State University Sacramento. I am majoring in sociology, criminal justice, and recently decided that I will minor in social work and attend Grad school upon my graduation since I discovered that I have a strong passion for helping others. I have worked and volunteered with underprivileged families and children for the vast majority of my life. I currently work at a school in Sacramento as a T.A and volunteer in a program called Reading Partners. As the holidays approach, I decided that the best gift that a child can receive is a good book since it will keep them learning and allow them to embark on a world of possibilities via the use of their imagination. I know that books are not the most popular items on Santa's List but they are in my list; since improving childrens literacy skills is very important to me. As a child, I always enjoyed reading but I understand that it is fundamental that children are allowed to pick their own books, that way they will actually enjoy what they are reading. I do not want to impose any particular book upon a child, but I am asking for donations of gently used or new books, or even better gift cards for local bookstores so that I can purchase the books that the children want. I plan to distribute the books among the children who reside in my community since those are the children that I have worked with the most and will donate the rest should there be any extras to some of the schools in the community where I have previously worked at.  Once I know that I have a few donors who are willing to help me in my cause, I will gather a list of names of books that the children are interested in and purchase them with the donations that I anticipate to receive. I am not asking for any sort of monetary contribution, books and gift cards to a local bookstore would be great. (Reading levels of k-12th Spanish or English) <br>
<br>
To clarify, the community where I will be donating the books is a low-income community where mostly individuals who work in agriculture reside. It is located in Watsonville and is accessible on Google maps or Google should you search for "Nuevo Amanecer Apartments Watsonville" or 15 Salinas Rd, Watsonville CA 95076.<br>
<br>
I thank you in advance for your help and any contribution that you might be able to provide. I can provide you with my references should you need to verify who I am. I assure you that I am a very honest person who knows that big change is hard but ideas are a first good step that is why although my plan is not completely concrete I hope that it can at least have some success. <br>

Hi!! My name is Megan and I'm currently new to the San francisco/ Berkeley location. I was a stylist is Sacramento. I have been a stylist there for 2 years and love doing what I do:)<br>
I am currently working at a salon called Festoon Salon in Berkeley and in Union Square in San Francisco (please look us up on Yelp or at our website www.festoonsalon.com, so you can feel comfortable with my training :)<br>
<br>
I am currently looking for line models for a Vidal Sasoon class. Which means any length as long as it's all the same length. No layers (unless you want to cut it off to the shortest layer). Bangs dont matter and any hair texture is welcomed :)<br>
<br>
<br>
Classes are always held on Mondays at 9am, 11am an 3pm<br>
<br>
The haircut is $20 and takes about an hour and half (instructors have to check everything, which is why it takes alittle longer)<br>
<br>
Please email me only if you are serious about my time and yours and what days and times work best for you.<br>
<br>
Also these classes are EXTREMELY important to me, so please take them seriously and treat them like any other appointment ( 42 hour cancellation policy ) because I will need t fill your spot.<br>
<br>
Email me a detailed message about your hair and please send a picture and then we will go from there :)<br>
<br>
Thank you soo much and I look forward in meet with you!! <br>

"Ayur" in Sanskrit means "life" and "Veda" means "science". It is a perfect Science of health and longevity. This holistic science is the knowledge of complete balance of the body, mind and spirit, including the emotions and psychology, on all levels. It includes in its consideration, longevity, rejuvenation and self-realization therapies through herbs, diet, exercise, yoga, massage, aromas, tantras, mantras, and meditation. According to Ayurvedic tradition, health is the balance of elements air, earth, fire, and water, and illness is an excess or deficiency of any particular element. Ayurveda treats illness at its source, rather than at the level of symptoms, and helps an individual to take responsibility for their own health and well being. Ayurveda is also known as 'Ashtanga Veda' (the word literally means 'Eight branches of knowledge') as it is divided into eight specialized branches.  <br>Yoga is a complete science of life that originated in India several thousands of years ago. It is the oldest system of personal development in the world, encompassing the entire body, mind and spirit. It is the union between a person's own consciousness and the universal consciousness. The classical techniques of Yoga date back more than 5,000 years. The word Yoga means "to join or yoke together," and it brings the body and mind together into one harmonious experience. <br>International volunteers will be learning the Basics of Yoga and Ayurveda in these three weeks of the project. Every day, there will be topics covered by a professional master (the person in charge of yoga and ayurveda classes), which will be practiced by the volunteers. Yoga will be practiced every day.<br>Apart from this, volunteers will also help in spreading awareness among the locals on issues like Health and Hygiene, environmental protection, solid waste management etc. Volunteers will need to be creative in their approach to give out the message through dramas and street plays. Volunteers who participate in this project need to bring materials and ideas for the program.

I also met new international friends and had many cultural exchanges with them and the children at St. Mary's school. This was a life changing experience for me and I plan to return to India in the future to study and live at a yoga ashram. I was fortunate enough to visit and stay at Amma's ashram near Allepey for a couple of days after the project finished. I personally think Kerala, South India is pure love! The head sister at the school was so warm and welcoming as were the people in Kannur. We learned about some of the Indian traditions and celebrations from our coordinator and team leader as well. I highly recommend this project if you are passionate about children, holistic practices and have an open mind.          Thank you." </i> Lisa Z.

Canal Alliance, a community nonprofit in the Canal neighborhood of San Rafael, has been offering English as a Second Language (ESL) classes for local immigrants for 25 years. The classes are for adults; the students are mostly Latino, with a sprinkling of other ethnicities. We offer seven levels of instruction, from beginner to advanced intermediate, serving over 500 students per term. The students are friendly, good-humored and very appreciative; it's great fun to work with them, and the work is extremely rewarding.<br>
<br>
For the spring 2012 term, which starts on January 23 and goes for 15 weeks, we need some additional teachers and classroom aides. A typical commitment is to serve as a teacher or aide in one class per week, lasting two hours. There are weekday classes at 10:00 a.m., 6:00 p.m., 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.; Saturday classes meet at 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. <br>
<br>
For teachers, we provide books, supplementary materials, curriculum guides, supplies, administrative support, and everything else needed to run a class. Teachers prepare their own lessons. Aides do a variety of things: they assist individual students, help the teacher model dialogues, check student work and give the students feedback, and so on. To be a teacher, some prior experience or training is the norm. To be an aide, no experience is necessary. For both positions, it's not necessary to speak Spanish. <br>
<br>
If you'll be away for part of the session, we have subs who can fill in for you. Alternatively, if you can't make a regular commitment, you can be on our sub list and come in from time to time to fill in for other teachers or aides.<br>
<br>
If you're interested in being a teacher or an aide, please call Martin at 415.306.0425 or send a note to the e-mail provided in this posting. (Calling usually works better.) We'll be happy to explain how the program works and what's involved in volunteering.<br>

I am looking for an English Speaking Tutor, preferably someone who is an ESL teacher, or is working/aspiring towards this goal (very mature college/high school students who have tutoring background feel free to apply). This tutoring is for my father, who is a wonderfully shy and kind sixty year old man that needs to practice his limited English speaking skills. The ideal person is patient and can get him to talk for an hour. We would start off two hours per week, an hour Monday and one Wednesday both from 7 to 8 pm. Maybe If this works for both parties we would increase the tutoring to three hours per week. The pay is $20 an hour, and you would have to come to his home in Menlo Park. If you are interested, shoot me an email with your experience and why you think you would be good for this job. A quick blurb will do.<br>

Our son has autism.  About two years ago, he had speech delays, could not hold a pencil, and would spend most of his time building towers of legos.<br>
<br>
Today, thanks to his loving and accepting friends who play with him in our home based Son Rise program, he has become a chatterbox, loves to draw, color, and cut, and enthusiastically participates in a number of different games and interactive activities.  (In the attached picture he is explaining a picture he drew.)<br>
<br>
We are excited about this, but we know he can go even further and enjoy everything his neuro-typical friends do.  Which is why we are looking for people like you who are fun, loving, and non-judgmental to join our team and be part of our play based Son Rise program. This has been a life-changing journey not only for our son but also for all our team members! If this interests you, we would love to hear from you.<br>
<br>

Our son has autism.  About two years ago, he had speech delays, could not hold a pencil, and would spend most of his time building towers of legos.<br>
<br>
Today, thanks to his loving and accepting friends who play with him in our home based Son Rise program, he has become a chatterbox, loves to draw, color, and cut, and enthusiastically participates in a number of different games and interactive activities.  (In the attached picture he is explaining a picture he drew.)<br>
<br>
We are excited about this, but we know he can go even further and enjoy everything his neuro-typical friends do.  Which is why we are looking for people like you who are fun, loving, and non-judgmental to join our team and be part of our play based Son Rise program. This has been a life-changing journey not only for our son but also for all our team members! If this interests you, we would love to hear from you.<br>
<br>
You need to be able to commit 4 to 6 hours per week. And, you should be willing to have fun! Apart from that, you do not need to bring anything... we will provide training.<br>

This year our outreach will be to those who are in unfortunate circumstances: children who are neglected, children with special needs, pregnant single mothers, and those with significant health crisis and/or injuries. We need people to begin to format the boxes that are going to be filled with presents and people to reach out to the community for donations of quality gift-worthy items. We already have items from our non-profit partners...but much more is needed as we approach the holiday season.

Volunteers needed. Researchers in the Departments of Physical Therapy at San Francisco State University and Samuel Merritt University in Oakland, California are conducting a study to understand how placing small amounts of weight on your torso will affect your ability to balance and move. We will compare the effects between people who have multiple sclerosis, who can walk but may have problems walking or keeping their balance, and people who have no neurological diagnoses.<br>
<br>
Depending on the phase of the study in which you will participate, you will come to either San Francisco State University (Phase I) or Samuel Merritt University in Oakland (Phase II). Participants in phase I will have a single session of two hours for motion analysis while walking. Participants in phase II will have a single testing session of about four hours to respond to questionnaires, stand up, walk, turn, and perform other activities related to balance and coordinated movement.  <br>
<br>
For people with MS, the Inclusion criteria are: <br>
&#61548;	English-speaking,<br>
&#61548;	diagnosed with MS,<br>
&#61548;	ambulatory for at least 25 feet with or without a cane,<br>
&#61548;	difficulties noted with balance or mobility, and<br>
&#61548;	physically capable of enduring up to four hours of testing with rest breaks.<br>
&#61548;	Participants must be willing to be nudged by a researcher when standing to determine balance loss.<br>
Exclusion criteria are: <br>
&#61548;	unable to comprehend and follow instructions,<br>
&#61548;	an exacerbation of MS within the past two months,<br>
&#61548;	diagnosed with a concurrent neurological disorder such as head injury, stroke or Parkinson disease, or<br>
&#61548;	experiencing pain that could be exacerbated by the external perturbation during standing balance and multiple trials of walking short distances.<br>
<br>
For healthy controls, the Inclusion criteria are: English-speaking, ambulatory, age within 5 years of a participant with MS (age-matched for phase I only). Exclusion criteria are: known diagnoses or current pain affecting balance or gait. <br>
<br>
If you are enrolled and complete the study, you will be given a $25 gift card to help with transportation costs. In addition, you will be given a parking pass if needed.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in participating, please contact the project coordinator via email at MotionStudy1@gmail.com or via phone at 415-338-6180. The project coordinator will determine if you are eligible, and, if so, schedule a time for testing. <br>

Lamorinda/WC based cat rescue group seeks foster families for homeless kittens.  Fun, rewarding, heart-warming... and all the joy of kittens without the long term responsibility of a cat.<br>
<br>
We need 3 kinds of help.  In addition to providing tons of love, care and attention.... <br>
1) can you bottle feed babies from birth to 2-3 weeks old, or do you want to learn more about it?<br>
2) can you provide a bathroom floor space for kitties 3 to 8-10 weeks old, or do you want to learn more about it?<br>
3) can you provide a bathroom space for kitties 8+ weeks old and take them to our adoption sites on the weekends?<br>
<br>
You provide space, love, litter, and food.  We provide all the medical care at no cost to you.  More information available, so if you're interested or know someone who is, please contact us.<br>
<br>
We are URGENTLY in need of fosters.  There are currently a minimum of 20 kittens that need placement into long-term foster homes.  <br>
<br>
We are a 501c3 group and can sign off on student community service hours as well.<br>
<br>
We need you.  The kitties need you.

Lamorinda/WC based cat rescue group seeks foster families for homeless kittens.  Fun, rewarding, heart-warming... and all the joy of kittens without the long term responsibility of a cat.<br>
<br>
We need 3 kinds of help.  In addition to providing tons of love, care and attention.... <br>
1) can you bottle feed babies from birth to 2-3 weeks old, or do you want to learn more about it?<br>
2) can you provide a bathroom floor space for kitties 3 to 8-10 weeks old, or do you want to learn more about it?<br>
3) can you provide a bathroom space for kitties 8+ weeks old and take them to our adoption sites on the weekends?<br>
<br>
You provide space, love, litter, and food.  We provide all the medical care at no cost to you.  More information available, so if you're interested or know someone who is, please contact us.<br>
<br>
We are URGENTLY in need of fosters.  There are currently a minimum of 20 kittens that need placement into long-term foster homes.  <br>
<br>
We are a 501c3 group and can sign off on student community service hours as well.<br>
<br>
We need you.  The kitties need you.

Some of these rescues are "toddlers" who are 3 to 8-10 weeks old.  They just need a place to get bigger and stronger.  They'll need lots of love from you, too.<br>
Some of these rescues are "kittens" who are anywhere from 2 months to 1 year of age.  They need a place to be socialized, or tamed, and taught to love.<br>
Some of these rescues are cats.  They are cats that are about a year old.  Like all the others, they just need a place to come in out of the cold, and taught to love and trust.<br>

Hi, I'm a good friend and caregiver for a disabled single mom up in Marin County. She's too sick to work and her husband passed away from cancer in 2006 - so her only income is a few hundred bucks a month from SSI.<br>
<br>
She has two older teenagers, a boy and a girl, and a seven year old nephew and a niece about the same age. And she'd really love to get them something for Christmas, as they don't normally get much due to the family situation and since holiday charity gift programs usually only cover very young kids. These teens work pretty much full time, doing all the household chores and babysitting for the niece and nephew.<br>
<br>
I'm broke and out of work myself, serving as a full-time caregiver for my grandma, who has heart failure and dementia and can't be left alone. So I can't leave the house and don't have any money to spend...but would love to see my friend and these kids get something this time around!<br>
<br>
The kids love listening to music, watching movies, making artwork on the computer, singing from home in improvised recording studios, clothes, shoes, concerts, trips places, Disneyland, Santa Cruz, the beach, etc. If anyone has any gently used, but still nice items they might like for Christmas, please respond to the email address and let me know! I have wishlists and clothes and shoe sizes for all of the children - will send to anyone who would like one. And we can put you directly in touch with the family and provide verification of their situation.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much, and Happy Thanksgiving!<br>
