Chloe is a 1 1/2 year old black and white girl waiting and hoping for a home.   She and her sublings (all tuxedos) were found as orphaned and unwanted 3 week olds and taken in by their foster mother.  Months later - they are FeLV/FIV tested, vaccinated, spayed/neutered and all ready for permanent homes and families...  but 3 of the 4 are still waiting for homes.<br>
<br>
Chloe is a sweet and affectionate girl.  She is a shy with strangers and in strange places, but at home is comfortable, cuddly, and playful.  She gets along well with other cats and has had a little exposure to dogs.<br>
<br>
Please help her find a home soon!  <br>

I have a 1974 two horse trailer that I am trying to sell, its in great condition only been used once since I bought it. It can hold two small horses or one large horse no bigger than 15 hands. I no longer have my horse so there is no reason for me to need it. I need to sell it. Many parts are new on it. The trailer hitch also comes with it since it needs a small ball. It is being stored now in Morgen Hill area. It is also a straight load. <br>
<br>
I am asking $2,000 for it.

I have a pure breed husky 6 months need a better home. I never have the time to stay home to play with it as we all know husky can not spend most of their time alone. He got one blue eye and one black eye. He is very friendly and very playful around everyone. He got all his shots, a microchip and he was also neutered earlier this month. He is potty train and is currently attending class at Petsmart. I'm asking for  a $700o.b.o re-homing fee since i have put out a lot of money. The crate ($100) will come with the dog. Local pick up only please.

<h1><font color="olive">Sweet little Wilma was rescued from a San Mateo office building as a kitten, she is now 2 1/2 years old and in need of lap time more than ever...<br><br>

Unfortunately, some of her kitty roommates have been known to bully her, so she hides until she knows that a human is there to keep her safe.  Whenever you sit down she magically appears, rolling back and forth on the floor and kneading and purring in your lap the whole time. <br><br>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://s1092.photobucket.com/albums/i412/miloby4/Kays%20adoptable%20cats/?action=view&amp;current=SAM_0317.jpg"><img src="http://i1092.photobucket.com/albums/i412/miloby4/Kays%20adoptable%20cats/SAM_0317.jpg"></a><br><br>
Wilma is a small package of pure sweetness and affection.  She would desperately love to find a quiet and stable home, free of worry.  She would do well with another mild mannered female, or she would be perfectly happy just to be alone with her humans.  Please call to arrange a visit with Wilma and make her life as sweet as it can be, she'll return the favor...<br><br>
All of our cats are:
<ul>
<li>spayed/neutered</li>
<li>microchipped</li>
<li>litterbox trained</li>
<li>given first vaccines</li>
<li>free of fleas</li>
</ul>
There is an adoption fee of $60 per cat or $100 for a pair.  This fee only covers a portion of their medical costs and care.</font>

We'll never understand why so many black cats are routinely passed over in favor of every other kind of cat.  At the end of kitten season, so many of these sweet deserving and beautiful cats remains in foster care, growing bigger and less adoptable by the day.  We all know that they are not bad luck, they are not witches companions and all the other superstitious stuff, yet still they are the hardest to adopt out.  Black cats are gorgeous, sleek and by many accounts, more mellow than their tabby, tortie, ginger counterparts.  Please consider paying a visit and helping one of these sweet kitties find their forever home.

I am a young man (about 1 year) with so much love and affection to give I can be quite the handful for my foster mom.  When she's unavailable I'll jump into a visitors lap and rub and headbutt them all over to show how much passion my heart holds for people.  Problem is, I can never seem to get enough attention being that I have to share with other kitties, so my poor heart beats in anticipation of that special someone to requite my feelings.  Once I get going it can be hard to walk away... I love to jump into your arms for a face to face embrace, and HATE when you try to put me down (why would you do that?)  I'll just squirm and wriggle and try to back up until you reconsider... I'm such a handsome boy; those photos don't really do me justice.

We adopted an adult shih-tzu mix, and of course bought everything we thought we needed and then some. Turns out our boy is super low maintenance, and doesn't need all we initially bought. Pick up in doorman building. $50 for all! <br>

This is my cat's grandson. Unfortunately they do not get along at all.This boy is a very playful, loving and affectionate cat. He plays fetch and loves to be held, Unfortuantely I need to find a home for him. My last hopes on keeping him were lost when he attacked his grandma tonight.... and he was not playing. They just really really don't like each other.<br>
He makes a wonderful baby, though i can't have him. I hate to have to let him go :(

I spotted a black dog, about 20# tonight, Wednedesday, Nov 30, 9pm, as I was pulling into my apartment complex on E. Blithedale in Mill Valley.  I didn't get a good look as it was very dark & the dog ran off before I could park. I did look for the dog but didn't see it again. <br>

Good luck with your search. I am a dog owner & would be devastated if anything happened to my dogs. I'll keep an eye out & re-post if I see the dog again.<br>

Sunny is a friendly 15 month male Chihuahua mix whose been with us for almost a year. We adopted Sunny from a friend who couldn't keep the 3 months old puppy at the time, and was going to leave him in the streets. We couldn't imagine Sunny out in the cold and hostile environment and did what anyone would have done. We took him in but only temporary until we can find him a good home where he will be loved and cared for but was quickly attached to Sunny's loving personality and eventually kept him for a year. Unfortunately, because of our increasingly busy schedule, we are unable to give him the attention that he deserves. Sadly, he is kept inside his cage most for most of the day but deserves to be out and free. Will you have to time to care and love Sunny? <br>
Sunny has not been neutered but is currently up to date with his vaccinations. With a $50 rehoming fee, we have Sunny's traveling kennel, his food, and favorite toys that will be given to you. You will be very lucky to have Sunny and he will bring joy to your life.<br>

Sunny is a friendly 15 month male Chihuahua mix whose been with us for almost a year. We adopted Sunny from a friend who couldn't keep the 3 months old puppy at the time, and was going to leave him in the streets. We couldn't imagine Sunny out in the cold and hostile environment and did what anyone would have done. We took him in but only temporary until we can find him a good home where he will be loved and cared for but was quickly attached to Sunny's loving personality and eventually kept him for a year. Unfortunately, because of our increasingly busy schedule, we are unable to give him the attention that he deserves. Sadly, he is kept inside his cage most for most of the day but deserves to be out and free. Will you have to time to care and love Sunny? <br>
Sunny has not been neutered but is currently up to date with his vaccinations. With a $50 rehoming fee, we have Sunny's traveling kennel, his food, and favorite toys that will be given to you. You will be very lucky to have Sunny and he will bring joy to your life.<br>

10 week old pup male beautiful dog. Owners of the mom didn't want to be bothered with finding homes for the pup. He is staying at our foster ranch, Mended Hearts, until adopted. Adoption fee includes: all puppy shots, deworming, flea control, heartworm meds, collar, leash, toyr, med records, food, treats, and we are available for phone questions. 925-752-6300 He has a long thin tail like a Ridgeback and slightly fluffy hair like a shepherd. Very sweet guy- "Rufus"!

We have two Pomeranian dogs which we bought about 6 years ago need a new home.<br>
<br>
I still have the pure breed certificate for the male.<br>
<br>
They are always together and they should be together in their new home as well.<br>
<br>
Please contact me if you are interested and you think you can provide good home for them.<br>
<br>
Some adoption fee may be applied.

We have two Pomeranian dogs which we bought about 6 years ago need a new home.<br>
<br>
I still have the pure breed certificate for the male.<br>
<br>
They are always together and they should be together in their new home as well.<br>
<br>
Please contact me if you are interested and you think you can provide good home for them.<br>
<br>
Some adoption fee may be applied.

<b>Casey</b> is a handsome 8-month old Black Lab mix we rescued from Merced. He did great with his first out-of-shelter bath and his coat is now looking great. He's a total love who adores belly scratches, chin rubs, and being near you. Casey is a smart pup and learned sit very quickly and is already moving on to "down." He's very treat-motivated and should be a fun pup to train. A friendly guy, he's done great with the people and dogs he's met. He's got a little white patch on his chest (adorable!). This shelter photo doesn't do this boy justice! He's a pretty mellow guy, curious and does great on leash. He's a solid boy with a nice thick coat. <br>
<br>
<b><font color="red">Casey needs a foster!</font> </b>When you foster a dog, you play an incredibly important role in saving that dog's life. We're a foster-based rescue and rely on foster homes to help dogs on their way to adoption. As a foster you get to enjoy the benefits of having a dog (or dogs) without the long-term commitment. It's also a great way to see what kind of dog might be right for you. Whatever your reasons, it's a tremendously rewarding experience - you are literally saving a life. Copper's Dream provides you with everything you need and maintains financial responsibility for veterinary care. <br>

<b>Abby</b> is a 7-month old Boxer mix we rescued from Merced. She's a sweet, very submissive, smaller gal who only weighs about 30 pounds.

<b>Abby</b> is a 7-month old Boxer mix we rescued from Merced. She's a sweet, very submissive, smaller gal who only weighs about 30 pounds. Her coat is amazingly soft, and she sat perfectly still for her first out-of-the-shelter bath. She really likes to be near you and will crawl into your lap when you sit down. <br>
<br>
<b>Upcoming Adoption Events!</b><br>
Saturday, December 3, Whole Foods - Palo Alto, 774 Emerson Street, 12 to 3pm<br>

<b>About Our Rescue</b><br>
Copper's Dream Animal Rescue focuses its work on pulling dogs from high kill shelters like Bakersfield, where 50% of the 500 new dogs taken in every week are put down. We spay and neuter them, get them up to date on vaccinations, and then house them until loving, permanent homes can be found. Adoption fees vary from dog to dog and are listed on our website. The adoption fee covers vaccinations, spay/neuter, usually kennel cough treatment, any other medical issues, and transportation and/or boarding fees if necessary. Every dollar of your adoption fee goes toward the care and treatment of our dogs. To learn more or donate, visit us at www.coppersdream.org. <br>

Copper's Dream is very short on foster homes right now (and are still currently looking for foster homes for a few of our dogs) so until we find a foster/adoptive home for this handsome boy, we can't rescue him. He is described as a 1 year old boxer/American bulldog mix who is WONDERFUL with all dogs and loves people. He is very interested in cats so he would have to be introduced slowly. Please let us know ASAP if you area able to foster this handsome boy.

<b>Monty</b> is a cuddly 4-month pit mix puppy we rescued from Lake County along with his siblings. He's a total love bug who adores snuggling up on the couch with you and hanging out in your lap for affection. He's pretty mellow for a puppy, but does have playful bursts of energy. He can be shy with new dogs in the beginning, but once he warms up he's all about play-time. At a recent dog park outing he did great with all the people but was a little unsure of all the dogs romping. Instead, he sat with a little 2-year old boy and was very sweet and gentle with him. He's also doing great with potty-training.<br>
<b>Milo</b> Are you looking for a pup that will absolutely adore you and curl up in your lap if you let him? Milo is a happy-go-lucky 4-month pit mix puppy we rescued from Lake County along with his siblings. He will become very attached to his eventual adopter, as he loves to follow his foster around adoringly. He's more than happy to sleep at your feet, or in your lap (although he's 22 pounds already). Milo is also a very happy bouncy pup. He loves other dogs and enjoys playing with them. He's a fan of fetch, but it's more of free-for-all-fetch...he'll bring you back the toy that catches his fancy (it's very cute!). Milo can be a little shy in new situations, but once he's had a chance to take it all in he's fine. At a recent dog park outing he sat with a little 2-year old boy and was very sweet and gentle with him (even when the child pulled his tail). He's a good listener and is learning basic commands in his foster home, as well as learning to walk well on leash.<br><b>Murphy</b> Murphy is a sweet, gentle 4-month pit mix puppy we rescued from Lake County along with his siblings. He's a respectful pup who gets along with the cat and dog in his foster home. He's happy to give you kisses if you let him, but he's not mouthy with you like some puppies can be. Murphy is taking pointers from the dog in his foster home and is learning to walk well on leash. He's also good about going outside to go to the bathroom when he has access. When Murphy isn't enjoying some fun play time, he can be found napping next to you on the couch. He's just very happy and content to be safe and out of the shelter. <br>

<b>Bonita</b> Bonita is indeed very pretty as her name suggests, but our photography skills aren't up to snuff to capture all that beauty! (we'll get some good shots soon). Bonita is a gentle, sweet pup looking for a loving home with a woman guardian and opportunities to play with other dogs. She loves going to dog parks, where she gets along with everyone. She's not a barker, unless she needs to announce a strange noise to you. While she's always up for an adventure, when she's in your home she'll be more than content to lay by your side. Bonita looks a lot like a Bull Terrier in person but the shelter originally labeled her a pit mix. We adopted out Bonita (then Muffin) as a puppy to a family that's now going through a change in their family situation and can no longer keep her. She prefers women and bonded very closely with her previous female guardian.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="red">Bonita</b></font> needs a foster! When you foster a dog, you play an incredibly important role in saving that dog's life. We're a foster-based rescue and rely on foster homes to help dogs on their way to adoption. As a foster you get to enjoy the benefits of having a dog (or dogs) without the long-term commitment. It's also a great way to see what kind of dog might be right for you. Whatever your reasons, it's a tremendously rewarding experience - you are literally saving a life. Copper's Dream provides you with everything you need and maintains financial responsibility for veterinary care. <br>
<br>

<b>Bonita</b> Bonita is indeed very pretty as her name suggests, but our photography skills aren't up to snuff to capture all that beauty! (we'll get some good shots soon). Bonita is a gentle, sweet pup looking for a loving home with a woman guardian and opportunities to play with other dogs. She loves going to dog parks, where she gets along with everyone. She's not a barker, unless she needs to announce a strange noise to you. While she's always up for an adventure, when she's in your home she'll be more than content to lay by your side. Bonita looks a lot like a Bull Terrier in person but the shelter originally labeled her a pit mix. We adopted out Bonita (then Muffin) as a puppy to a family that's now going through a change in their family situation and can no longer keep her. She prefers women and bonded very closely with her previous female guardian.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="red">Bonita</b></font> needs a foster! When you foster a dog, you play an incredibly important role in saving that dog's life. We're a foster-based rescue and rely on foster homes to help dogs on their way to adoption. As a foster you get to enjoy the benefits of having a dog (or dogs) without the long-term commitment. It's also a great way to see what kind of dog might be right for you. Whatever your reasons, it's a tremendously rewarding experience - you are literally saving a life. Copper's Dream provides you with everything you need and maintains financial responsibility for veterinary care. <br>
<br>

<b>About Our Rescue</b><br>
Copper's Dream Animal Rescue focuses its work on pulling dogs from high kill shelters like Bakersfield, where 50% of the 500 new dogs taken in every week are put down. We spay and neuter them, get them up to date on vaccinations, and then house them until loving, permanent homes can be found. Adoption fees vary from dog to dog and are listed on our website. The adoption fee covers vaccinations, spay/neuter, usually kennel cough treatment, any other medical issues, and transportation and/or boarding fees if necessary. Every dollar of your adoption fee goes toward the care and treatment of our dogs. To learn more or donate, visit us at www.coppersdream.org. <br>

<b>Fred</b> is a loyal, friendly, cuddly 2-3 year old Bassett Hound/pit mix we rescued from Delano. He might be one of the funniest-looking dogs you'll ever see-- and we mean that in a good way! Fred has the front legs & body of a Bassett, but he can jump pretty high for a guy with short legs (agility contender?). Fred is so friendly and so much fun! He loves outings to the beach or walks where he can meet new people or pups--getting along great with everyone. When you're not home he's content to just hang out with his bones or toys (if outside, won't dig holes or climb fences). When you are home, he loves to cuddle with you on the couch, bed, or by your feet. Fred knows the commands for sit, no, come, and "gotta pee?". When he barks, which is usually just to announce a strange sound outside, he has a Bassett voice. He's just a happy pup, good with other dogs and will wiggle when other pups look at him. Fred is good on leash and like his walks. <br>

My name is Gizmo and I am a small, 2-year-old terrier mix with an unusually lovely red and black coat. I am energetic and happy and I LOVE treats and enjoy  belly rubs. It would be best if any children in my house are over 10 years old. If you would like a cuddly  and fun-loving guy in your life, come meet me at Oakland Animal Services, and bring my number: #04876<br>

I have Two Red Eared Sliders with their Habitat I need to rehome, These guys are a bout 1 year old and about 4 inches each, They were rescued from someone that left them out side in a kiddie pool, They are eating well with greens and or pellets and are always happy to greet us at feeding time. I would like to find a home ASAP, i am asking for a small Rehoming Fee of $50.00 which is no where near what the habitat cost me. Their habitat is 30" long, 13" tall and 12.5" wide, it has a basking lamp, a uv lamp, a heater and a filter. It also has a landing pad, and a raised stone for basking in.<br>
<br>
Please dont waste my time, or yours, yes if you are reading this the turtles are still looking for a new.home, $50.00 is a fair rehoming price so no I will not barter the price. I get back to emails as quickly as I can so if you take the time to email me, and I take the time to respond, do me a favor let me know if you do want them or not Thank You.

Hi, I'm Lexie. Are you looking for a friend with Personality Plus? That's me. I am quite the character. I will greet you as soon as you come in, purring like mad. I love to play with you and the other cats and vie for your attention. I am such an engaging and lively gal that I make people smile. I can't believe that my family from before pretended not to know me when the shelter called the phone number on my microchip. But, hey. . .I'm putting all that behind me and I'm ready for a new start and I'm ready to come home with you today.<br>

I have a year and a half old male black cat who is in need of a new home. Unfortunately I am not home enough between work and school and he is a cat the prefers attention and lots of it even if it is just being in the same room as you. He is very laid back and very sweet. He is also super cuddly when he is in the mood. If he is not he'll just lie nearby. I have never had an issue with scratching or hissing as his personality is pretty low key. He is good with the litterbox but is particular about its cleanliness. He doesn't like it when there is too much of another cats smell in it and he will let you know. He has had all his shots and is very healthy with the exception of maybe a little extra weight. If interested please email me or call/text me at 530-613-6029.

Are you looking for the perfect all around cat who will make you happy? If so, then you really ought to meet me. I'm Sparta and I'm a mellow, easy to handle guy who is just adorable. I am ever so sweet and I like to be around people. I do have a playful side and so we could have great fun together. I think that if all this sounds good to you, you should come and ask to meet me. Once you have spent time with me, I'm hoping that you will want to make me part of your family. I would be ever so grateful if you do.<br>

Are you looking for the perfect all around cat who will make you happy? If so, then you really ought to meet me. I'm Sparta and I'm a mellow, easy to handle guy who is just adorable. I am ever so sweet and I like to be around people. I do have a playful side and so we could have great fun together. I think that if all this sounds good to you, you should come and ask to meet me. Once you have spent time with me, I'm hoping that you will want to make me part of your family. I would be ever so grateful if you do.<br>

Sandy and Lindsay are two gorgeous female guinea pigs looking for a good home.  Currently living with a foster mom in Sunnyvale, the girls (ages between 6 months and 1 year old) are getting used to children and other family members.  At present, they really seem to love parsley, carrots and celery in addition to their pellets and hay.  They now weigh 2.75 pounds, but may get a little bit bigger.  <br>

Hi, I'm Galena and I am very comfortable around people. I'm friendly and sweet and I enjoy getting affection when the volunteers spend time with me. I even like being brushed because I know it makes me look extra pretty. In addition to my gentle demeanor, I do have a playful side and when I get a chance, I enjoy toys. It's a great way to get exercise too. I'm gentle, sweet, loving, petite, playful and an all around great feline. So why not see for yourself and spend some time with me. I'll wait right here for you.<br>

I have a female ball python that needs a new home. She is a strong feeder on adult mice (live) and very beautiful as well as solid bodied.<br>
Around 300g. I'm asking $20<br>
<br>
I also have a rescued savanah monitor baby. Appears healthy and is doing great for me.  Eats crickets, mealworms, snails, red wigglers, waxworms etc. I've put a chunk of change into setting this guy up right so I'm looking to get $100. <br>
I can include the lights (1 basking, 1 UVB) for that price.   If  you want the whole 40gal (mind you this is a very temporary set up once he/she starts growing, needs a custom top) I'll give it up for $160 for everything. <br>
Experienced reptile keepers preferred! I will not sell this monitor to anyone under the age of 18 as these animals are a serious commitment.<br>
<br>
Email only, pick up only.  Will consider trades for ball pythons morphs. No normal, pastel, or spider males. No normal females. No hets.<br>
<br>
Thanks for looking,<br>

Hi - Copper's Dream Rescue is doing a massive rescue of lots of pups that are on the euthanasia list at Red Bluff pound, and we need foster homes for all of them. They arrive on Fri. We'll provide crate, collar, leash and food.<br>
<br>
Please let us know if you're interested in fostering (and pls provide a number where we can reach you).  Thanks! (The pics below are two of the many dogs that need homes.)<br>

<p>Blue Moon's mother was a blue point Siamese. he's a bit of a talker like his mom. She has been adopted, but her kitten is still available. He's very sweet pretty & friendly, gets along great with other cats, and is playful. He is currently being fostered with a Pekenese so seems fine with small dogs that won't bother him. He LOVES to be held and be on your lap and LOVES his brushing and attention. He is very much the in your face snuggler. He may be a little skitty on a fast approach but I think because it is usually quiet in his foster home. He is being treated for a scratch on his eye, which is healing. This kitty can be seen at Pet Food Express by appointment or on our adoption days at Pet Food Express the 2nd Sat. in Danville, 3rd Sat. in Walnut Creek 12:30-4:30 Still not sure on a pet? Talk to us about fostering this kitty or any other one, even for one month. Adoption fee is $100, plus $15 for microchip<p>

Put a little sunshine in your life! Sunshine and her kittens were taken to a kill shelter. We rescued them on her last day, and she is in a foster home, and available to be adopted! She is friendly, sweet, and likes petting. Very quiet. Most orange cats are male, so she's a rare female! She very young, probably about 1 year old or less. She's a beautiful orange color, with a white chest, and white paws, beautiful amber colored eyes, and a pink nose. She's a bit shy at first, but warms up when she knows you. All of her kittens were adopted.! Adoption fee is $100, plus $15 for microchip id.

Our Non-profit Cat Rescue REALLY needs your help!<p>
Maybe you bought some canned food, and your finicky kitty won't eat it?  We can use unopened cans for our cats and kittens!<p>
We work purely on a donation budget and are in need of wet food for our kittens. <p>Cash donations are way down, due to the economy.<p>We have received a great donation of dry kitten food but they really need wet canned food to thrive. Any brand of kitten food is fine. Walmart usually has the best prices. No donation is too small. <p>We adopt out of Pet Food Express in both Danville and Walnut Creek ,and the store is usually fine with donations being brought there for us to pick up. We try to get it the same day so it doesn't interfere with their space.<p> We are foster based, and we pull cats and kittens out of kill shelters in California, saving many cat lives.<p>Thank you for ANY  help you can give to these little guys. We can supply the homes care and love to socialize them and get them ready for good homes. We will also be looking for flea meds (Advantage II for dogs works just as well) if anyone has any they don't need anymore,  as well as shots. A tray of 25 shots runs about $90 with shipping. <p>We have never had to rely on the help of strangers as we do now.<p>
Please help us help these cats and kittens!  We can pick up in the East Bay area.  Please email if you can help!  Thank you again.

Studies show that black cats are about half as likely to be adopted as other cats. On average, they stay several months longer in shelters than any other cats. And they are often ignored by rescue groups because they are so hard to place. Black cats are frequently left waiting in pounds and shelters hoping to find a home only to be destroyed when their time is up. 

<p>We have rescued cute little black kittens, short, medium, and long haired cats, all have been fostered in homes, had vaccinations, tested negative for Feline AIDS/Leukemia. Some have been waiting for a forever home for a year!  But living in a foster home, they get lots of love, and they will have lots of love to give YOU and your family members!

Please give these guys a chance!  Don't overlook these sleek and regal beauties when looking for a new furkid for your family.  Their playful, easygoing attitude will charm you into making them a permanent part of your family!<p>
Come see some at  our adoption days at Pet Food Express the 2nd Sat. in Danville, 11:30-4:30, Come to see them at Pet Food Express in Danville 2nd Saturday of the month 11:30 - 4:30 or Walnut Creek PFE same times 3rd and 5th Saturday of the month. <p>

Black cats have a common characteristic of being easy-going and good-natured. They have so much love to offer and ask for so little in return. Black cats often have sturdy builds and thick, full coats.Black cats do not all look alike and if you look closely you will see that they are truly gorgeous and regal creatures. The glossy satin sheen of a black cat is unlike any other. When their fur catches the light, it shimmers. There are many different kinds of black cats and all are beautiful - auburn shaded black, blue black, black with tiny white highlights, sleek black, fluffy black, soft black, and colorful eyes -- green, gray, yellow, copper. Some black cats even have tabby markings. 
<p>Here are just a few of the black cats and kittens that are available for adoption or foster:<p>

Studies show that black cats are about half as likely to be adopted as other cats. On average, they stay several months longer in shelters than any other cats. And they are often ignored by rescue groups because they are so hard to place. Black cats are frequently left waiting in pounds and shelters hoping to find a home only to be destroyed when their time is up.

Snuggles was rescued with a sister and brother from a kill shelter. They all had very bad upper respiratory infections (colds).  Unfortunately, his sister and brother got pneumonia and despite medications, didn't make it. Snuggles survived, and plays happily with adult and kitten friends in his foster home.  He likes to snuggle, hence his name.  He tested negative for Feline AIDS/Leukemia, was neutered, has his shots, and has a microchip.<p>
We've been looking for a good home for him for months, but since he's a black and white tuxedo, he's passed over at our adoption days for orange, grey, and other kittens of other colors.<p>
This makes us very sad.  
:-( <p>
Black cats are often the last choice for people interested in getting a new cat, because of superstition, or due to prejudice. But we think Snuggles is handsome and beautiful, with his green eyes, cute white feet, white bib, and white stripe down his nose!<p>
He just needs someone to love and to love him!<p>
It would be great if he had another cat to keep him company.<p>

Cookie Dough is a sweet little siamese  kitten with blue eyes, about  5 months old (dates of birthday are approximate.). She's a "Harlequin" kitty, with white on one side of her nose, and brown on the other.   She needs to be indoors and needs the company of another kitten or cat. She has a sibling named Cocoa Puff that is also available (a boy siamese). He's a Linx Point siamese with blue eyes.  They love to play together. We think they might be a Himalayan mix.  They have been fostered with other cats in a smoke-free home.<p>

<h2>NOTE: I have some slots available to catsit in the afternoons or evenings during the holidays!<p>
I am an experienced Cat Sitter and Reiki Practioner. I have fostered many cats and kittens for  several years. I have 6 cats of my own, and have had cats since I was eight years old. I am certified in pet CPR and First Aid. <br>
<br>I 
 have many excellent references, and have lived in my house in the Rockridge area for over 20 years. <br>
Services include: <br>
* Collecting mail and newspapers <br>
<br>
* Putting out trash carts the night before trash pickup <br>
<br>
* A Reiki treatment with each visit <br>
<br>
* Feeding & proving water for cats <br>
<br>
* Administering certain medications, fluid injections, or vitamins <br>
<br>
* Cleaning litter boxes <br>
<br>
* Playtime with your cat <br>
<br>
* Kitty massage therapy <br>
<br>
* Daily email with information on how cat is doing if requested <br>
<br>
* And lots and lots of tender loving care! <br>
<br>
Healing Reiki energy can calm your cat, reducing separation anxiety and stress while you are away. Reiki is "universal life force energy" that can be harnessed <br>
to clear blockages, bring back balance and harmony within the mind, body and spirit, and effect healing. It can be a "hands-on" treatment, or sent to the cat <br>
without touching the cat. <br>
<br>
Oakland, Emeryville, and Berkeley areas only, due to gas prices. <br>
<br>
Cost: $25 per visit, depending on services and location (I usually stay an hour or more). <br>

Samantha, a Chocolate Point Tortie Siamese cat. about a year old, and very sweet. She's little shy, but when she knows you, loves petting. She's playful, and gets along great with other cats. She's skinny, in the classic Siamese way.  She likes to sit on laps and be petted. <p>Samantha says, " I'm a real lapcat, and have a lot of love to give!" <p>I am spayed 1 vaccinated, and have tested negative for Feline AIDs and Leukemia. And indoor home with adults would be best for me. Adoption fee is $100, plus $15 for microchip id.<p>
Come see her at the Pet Food Express stores in Walnut Creek or Danville:<p> 

Danville store: 2nd Sat. of the month, 609 San Ramon Valley Boulevard Danville, CA 94526-4013 (925) 837-1777<br>

2 1/2 year old beautiful tabby with white feet, chest and nose and bright blue eyes, very soft and loves to be petted...all he wants to do is sit in your lap or hang out near by. He is very calm and sweet natured, would be the ideal cat for a single or older person. He is a little on the shy side so a busy and active house would probably not be best for him. He is currently allowed outdoors but spends most of his time inside and would be happy as an indoor cat. He gets along fine with other cats and easy going dogs. He is litter box trained and doesn't scratch furniture at all, a very neat and tidy guy:) If you are looking for a kitty who will sleep next to you all night, sit on your lap when you watch tv and purr whenever you come near him, he is the one! He is neutered, up do date on vaccines and FIV/FLV negative, a very healthy kitty! He is such a pleasure to be around, it is impossible not to fall in love with him. Please email or call me for information, my number is 510 918 1982. Adoption fee applies. Thanks!

This has got to be the most ridiculous post I have seen in awhile.  Actually it makes me more want to shop Stonestown Mall knowing the management is on top of things.

Yes it is private property and they can set the rules.  If my kid ran up to your dog and poked at it as littles do or even petted it and he bit my child of course anyone would pursue medical expense reimbursement if needed (plastic surgery can be expensive for facial bites) - against you if you had the balls to admit it was your dog and second to the mall - it is their responsibility to keep it safe for patrons.  If the dog is taken by a passerby - whatcha going to do - blame Security?  A responsible dog owner would not tie their dog outside a busy mall for any time.  Even a great dog - being tied up outside Stonestown Mall on that chaotic street, etc is going to be feeling very stressful, esp with the xmas shopping crowds.   Unbelievable.<br>

Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
I live near Stonestown, and have gone there regularly to shop. I have heard dogs were stolen in front of the Mall ( dogs which were tied outside) . I have heard people talk about that, and seen signs of lost/stolen dogs.<br>
<br>
Today, I went to the Mall, and I have a big dog which I only leave outside when I can see him from where I go. I left him outside for 3 minutes, and there was a guy who was trying to take him, while talking on the phone asking for someone to come help him. I got outside and he said he was part of management ( he did have a security tag and uniform), and since it was the Mall' s property, private property, dogs are not allowed to be outside tied to a pole. He said " we take the dogs, if they are alone". He didn't want to say WHERE they take the dogs! !!!<br>
<br>
If that guy was there only a minute after I had tied my dog ( I could see him so I ran outside when I saw that guy near my dog) , I wonder ; How could other dogs have been stolen there, by anyone except the Mall management!!! <br>
<br>
Since he didn't want to say where they take the dogs, I suspect they steal dogs. <br>
<br>
Please if you love dogs, don't shop there!<br>
<br>
Whether they steal dogs, or take people's dogs away from where the owner left her/him, which is illegal unless they put a sign along their sidewalk, Stonetown area and management is definitely suspicious. As much as it is not advised to leave your dog outside a store, it is not illegal ( I suggest a chain, and a lock from the chain to the collar if you have to do it without having a constant eye on the dog).<br>
<br>
Please don't shop at Stonestown if you can! <br>

I have a male cinnamon ball python for trade or adoption. <br>
Great eater<br>
Mite free<br>
Infection free <br>
Atleast a couple hundred grams. <br>
He is a lighter shade of cinnamon not what you would typically see. If u want better pictures ill be more then happy to send them. But he is a beauty.<br>
I will trade but only for ball pythons. Preferably the same size or bigger. Let me know what tour offer is, snake or price.

I have a male cinnamon ball python for trade or adoption. <br>
Great eater<br>
Mite free<br>
Infection free <br>
Atleast a couple hundred grams. <br>
He is a lighter shade of cinnamon not what you would typically see. If u want better pictures ill be more then happy to send them. But he is a beauty.<br>
I will trade but only for ball pythons. Preferably the same size or bigger. Let me know what tour offer is, snake or price.

To make a long, heart wrenching story short:<br>
<br>
Someone had a pointless litter of pitbulls that they couldn't take care of anymore and gave them away at 5 weeks old. They were extremely malnurioushed and needed some help. I contacted all of my dog savvy freiends and we each took a few to strengthen up and find amazing homes for. <br>
<br>
They are being extensively socialized with us and are getting stronger by the day.<br>
<br>
They are both black and white. One has a perfect blaze and one has a split face. The blazed girl is more outgoing and "in your face". The split face is champion cuddler! <br>
<br>
Rehoming fee is 100$ (This covers de-worming and vaccinations) They will be ready to go in a few weeks.<br>
<br>
If you're interested please contact me with a little about yourself!

Hi everyone. We have to give up our loving dog marley. Marley is still a puppy and is just under a year. Marley is super nice and playful. Marley just got a little to big and plays to rough with our kids. She doesn't bite. She is half black lab and half mastiff, thats what we were told at least. She is big though. We are only asking $50 for her to get someone who is serious about getting her. She loves people and knows how to sit. She does pretty well walking on a leach. More  Pictures are upon request. Thank you for reading and take care.

Sumner is a 1 year old Male Cairn Terrier. This little guy is lively and loves treats and loves to sniff everything.  He will stand up excitedly for treats.  He runs after toys but didn't pick them up.  He liked getting neck/side of face scritches and leans in for a good rub.  He was ok with being handled (body, tail, legs) once a relationship was developed, but avoided the teeth check like the dickens.  No nipping or biting, just tries to get away, shaking his head.  Ok with being picked up but not wild about it.  He seemed surprised to be picked up, then licked his lips nervously.  He really wanted to approach this poodle in the lobby, pulled on the leash quite a bit.  Handsome boy. Once outside he was preoccupied by all the smells on the ground.  He's very much a Terrier and will be a nice active companion!

He quickly warms up to be friendly, social, and quite playful.  He will need an owner that is active and has large breed experience.  If there are kids in Rocky's new home, older ones will be just fine.
