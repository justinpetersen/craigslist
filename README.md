craigslist
==========

Mobile Craigslist web app that displays thumbnails in listings. This uses the Sencha Touch mobile UI framework. It uses Sencha v1, so it is not as snappy as it would be if I were to build it now. Craigslist have since added a thumbnail and gallery view to search results as well. This project was from 2011.
